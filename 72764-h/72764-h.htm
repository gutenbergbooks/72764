<h2 class="super xxl">THE MONGOLS<br>
IN RUSSIA</h2>
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">EARLY HISTORY OF RUSSIA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In my history of the Mongols we have seen how Hulagu beguiled the Assassins and slaughtered
them. We have seen also how he ended the Kalifat at Bagdad, showing no more regard
for the heir of Mohammed than for the chief of those murderers who held that marvelous
mountain-land south of the Caspian. The Kalif of Islam was trampled to death under
horse-hoofs. The chief of the Assassins was treated with insult, endured for a time,
and then slain like a wild beast.
</p>
<p>We are now to consider an expedition planned at that Kurultai held during Ogotai’s
election, and see what was done by its leader, an expedition which ruined large portions
of Europe as far as the Adriatic, and made Batu, the nephew of Jinghis Khan, supreme
lord of them.
</p>
<p>The Mongols retreated from all lands west of the Carpathians and confined themselves
exclusively to that part of Europe which we know as Russia. The West was too narrow
for them, too mountainous, too much diversified, and contained too little pastoral
land. It had too much culture, and differed too greatly from that immense open region
which stretches from the Dnieper, or more correctly from the Danube, to that vast
ocean of water which was later called the Pacific.
</p>
<p>This region is made up of those spaces lying north of the Great Wall of China, that
largest fence ever reared by man to ward off an enemy, and farther west by the greatest
barrier raised upon <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>earth through creation, and also used by man as a line of defense, a fortress of refuge,
that unique mountain system extending from Eastern China to Persia, and then, with
a break, to the Caspian. From the Caspian westward the immense space is bounded by
the Caucasus and the Black Sea, till it reaches the Danube and the mountains just
north of that river.
</p>
<p>This vast region, or Mongol careering ground as we may call it, began on the east
at waters which are really the Pacific, and on the west touched the Danube, which
finds its source very near the Rhone and the Rhine, both flowing into the Atlantic,
since the North Sea, with its waters, is merely a part of that ocean.
</p>
<p>The width of this region extends from the southern boundary just given to the Arctic,
or Frozen Ocean. The entire southern part, somewhat less than half of this entire
area, was an open, treeless country, grass-growing land and sand plains. All along
on the northern side of this southern division were great stretches of grass land,
with small groves of trees, from one acre to one hundred in area. Lands of this kind
are seen in Siberia to our day. In the center were fruitful spots, deserts and oases.
In the east, next to the center, were boundless plains, with a greater proportion
of forest toward the distant east and toward the north, but with clear spaces everywhere.
On the south, from the Danube to the Chinese Sea, the country was open at all points.
</p>
<p>Such was the Mongol careering ground, and after they had overrun Europe to the Adriatic
and north of it they retired to the western part of this great open country of Eastern
Europe, and made their capital at Sarai, just east of the Volga, and perhaps two hundred
miles north of the Caspian.
</p>
<p>But before writing of the Mongol invasion of Russia, it will be necessary to give
a somewhat detailed history of Russia previous to that event.
</p>
<p>It is, of course, not known when the Russians settled in their present territory.
In the first half of the ninth century they occupied a large extent of land stretching
from the Carpathians to the upper waters of the Don and the Volga, and from the neighborhood
of Lake Ladoga to a point about half-way between Kief and the Black Sea. All this
population lived in villages which were governed in patriarchal fashion by the heads
of families. A number of village communities formed a volost, or district, which was
<span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>the largest government unit in the country. The size of these volosts varied, according
to the convenience or the necessities of the case, but in general they were small.
As the Slavs were much attached to their village autonomy, and as there was an inexhaustible
supply of land, it was quite impossible for a large community to subdue and absorb
a weaker one, for the latter had always the power of removing to some unoccupied district
and setting up its little republic in the wilderness.
</p>
<p>The family system in force among the Slavs greatly favored this process, for a family
was not, as in modern times, composed of parents and children only, but of two, three
and even four generations. The head of this family was the oldest person in it, and
its size was regulated by power of agreement among the members. There were often forty,
fifty, or a hundred persons living in one family, all obeying a single head. A few
such families formed a village, a few villages a volost, which was sometimes as large
as one of our counties. The tendency of a society like this was altogether toward
expansion. After reaching a certain size the village community divided, one part remaining
in the old place, the other selecting a new field for its industry. It was only at
a few points favorable for trade that a large number of people lived together—Novgorod
near Lake Ilmen was the most conspicuous example of this kind. It is evident that
people living in this manner had little power of combination and could offer but slight
resistance to invasion.
</p>
<p>Novgorod, situated near the confluence of the different rivers, and in direct communication
with the Baltic, became a great trading point, and was not only the most populous
place in the whole country, but the first in which civil government began. It was
a market-place for the goods of Europe and Asia, and soon rose to a position of wealth
and importance. Its government was an extension of the communal system of the country,
and was in fact a confederation of villages, held together very loosely. Such a place
offered an excellent point of attack to the Northmen, the most enterprising and rapacious
of mankind, who at that period left no European country in peace.
</p>
<p>In the south the Kazars, a powerful Asiatic horde, took tribute and left the inhabitants
to their own devices. This tribute was simply the price of being let alone. In the
north it was different; <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>the Scandinavians, who made their presence felt wherever they went, wanted not only
profit, but power. They were greedy of rule, and wished to direct the affairs of Novgorod.
This was unendurable; the citizens rose up, drove out the strangers, and began to
govern themselves as in the old time. Theirs was no easy task, for the place was divided
into parties, or rather factions, neither one of which had the power to govern. While
affairs were in this troubled state, Gostomyal, the elder or president of the city,
rose on a certain occasion and addressed the assembled multitude. Reminding them of
their previous condition and present peril, he said that being easily inflamed by
passion they were unfit to rule, that if they continued as they were the stranger
would surely come, bringing dishonor to their wives and daughters and slavery to themselves,
that too late they would shed bitter tears. He closed by advising them to invite from
abroad some wise, strong man to govern according to their laws.
</p>
<p>Under the immediate influence of this speech, a deputation was chosen and sent to
the chieftain Rurik. The gist of their message was: “Our lands are broad and rich,
but there is no order therein; do thou come and rule over us.”
</p>
<p>Rurik came that same year, bringing with him his two brothers, Sineus and Truvor,
and a certain force of his own, which was considerably increased after his arrival
by native recruits. Who Rurik was is still a question among Russian historians, but
it is generally conceded that he was a Scandinavian, though efforts have been made
to show that he was from some Slav tribe on the southern coast of the Baltic.
</p>
<p>The political history of Russia begins in 862, when these three brothers came to rule
over Novgorod lands. The great importance claimed for this election is that an executive
power, independent of all native factions, was introduced without conquest, an event
unexampled in Western Europe, where the introduction of a foreign dynasty was attended
always by foreign conquest.
</p>
<p>At first Rurik, the eldest brother, settled in Ladoga, and Sineus at Bailozero. Truvor
went to Izborsk to hold the Livs in check. Two years after their coming Sineus and
Truvor vanish from history, whether by a natural death or through violence is not
now known to any man. Rurik then advanced from the Ladoga region to Novgorod. He founded
several towns, which were simply <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>stockaded forts, centers of settlement. He conquered Finnish tribes and sent his lieutenants
to govern at needful points. At Novgorod he built a castle, and remained in that city
till his death, which took place fifteen years later. During those years, he extended
Novgorod rule on the west to the Upper Dvina, and on the south to the sources of the
Dnieper.
</p>
<p>Rurik died in 879 and was succeeded by Oleg, a nephew, or at least a near relative,
a man of vast plans and great resources. Soon after his election Oleg, leaving a posadnik,
or lieutenant at Novgorod, moved toward the south with a large force composed of Varangians,
Slavs, and Fins. He had with him his ward, Igor, Rurik’s only son, then in childhood.
The new prince took possession of Smolensk, Lubetch, and all other towns and villages
which he found south of Novgorod. Whether these places came to him by force or by
agreement no chronicler tells us. He pressed forward till he came to Kief, where he
found a principality which had its origin during the lifetime of Rurik, in the following
manner,—
</p>
<p>Two of Rurik’s warriors, Askold and Dir, received permission to go to Tsargrad with
the view of enrolling themselves in the guard of the Emperor. Traveling by the usual
route of the Dnieper, they arrived at Kief, which so charmed them by its beauty, and
the beauty of the surrounding country, that they at once decided to go no farther.
The inhabitants of this place were tributary to the Kazars. The two warriors collected
a number of Scandinavians and other adventurers, put themselves in the place of the
Kazars, and began their rule, which was soon extended over tribes round about. The
number of their adherents was increased by fugitives from Novgorod, opponents of Rurik.
After a time their power became so considerable that they fitted out an expedition
against Tsargrad. As their galleys approached the city, the Greeks invoked their patron
saint, and dipped his image in the waters of the Bosphorus. A terrible storm came
upon the invaders and destroyed the greater part of their fleet. This event, which
was attributed to divine interposition, is said to have made such an impression upon
Askold and Dir that they became Christians. This took place several years before Oleg’s
arrival at Kief.
</p>
<p>Finding an organized rule as an obstacle in his path, Oleg was not slow to act, and
his conduct was in keeping with the Norse <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>cunning of that age. Leaving the greater part of his fleet behind him, he sailed up
to Kief with a few boats, in which warriors were concealed; then he sent messengers
to the rulers of Kief, saying that some of their countrymen, merchants, were on their
way to Tsargrad and would like to show them their wares. The unsuspecting princes
went on board Oleg’s boat. They were seized by men-at-arms; then Oleg stepped forth
and said: “You are neither princes nor of princely race. I am a prince, and with me
is Igor, the son of Rurik.” And he had them put to death at once;<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e462src" href="#xd32e462">1</a> then he took possession of Kief for Rurik’s son.
</p>
<p>In Kief Oleg fixed himself firmly, declaring that thenceforth it should be called
the mother of Russian towns. His first care was to build fortifications in the new
territory, both to secure his own power and to defend the country from the Asiatic
tribes of the steppes. He spent nearly thirty years, however, in gaining authority
over tribes south, east and west of the new capital, before he felt strong enough
to make an attack on Tsargrad.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e468src" href="#xd32e468">2</a>
</p>
<p>In 907 he set out on his famous expedition against the Eastern Empire. A large force,
composed of Slavs, Scandinavians and Fins, accompanied him. The number of his boats,
perhaps overstated, is given at two thousand. Forty men went in each boat. When the
fleet touched the Bosphorus, the Greeks closed the Golden Horn, and also the gates
of the capital.
</p>
<p>Oleg’s men put their craft on the shore, and then used fire and sword around the city
with such vigor that the terrified Emperors were glad to buy peace dearly. With the
peace was concluded a treaty of commerce, the first Russian treaty known to history.
Oleg nailed his shield to one of the city gates as a mark of victory, and returned
home in triumph, bringing with him such booty as no man had seen north of the Euxine
till that day.
</p>
<p>The effect of this exploit was very great. Oleg was surnamed “the Seer” by his admiring
subjects, who felt proud of his, and of their own fame. He had led many of them across
the Black Sea to the capital of the Cæsars. He had roused the imagination of all.
From being villagers they had become members of a political commonwealth, able to
impose terms on one of the great powers of the earth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>Oleg was a keen diplomat rather than a warrior, a ruler who, by shrewd management,
brought many tribes under his sway without striking a blow. He was undoubtedly the
greatest politician of pagan Russia.
</p>
<p>In 912 Oleg died. The tradition is that some years earlier he had been warned by a
wizard that the horse he was riding would cause his death. The prince dismounted at
once, sent this favorite steed away to be cared for, and never rode him again. On
being told that the horse was dead and his bones were bleaching in the field, he resolved
to go and look at them, saying: “These wizards are always lying. The horse is dead,
and I am living.” When he came to where the bones were, he pushed the skull with his
foot, and exclaimed: “This was to be my death!” That instant a serpent sprang out
and bit him in the leg, and straightway he sickened and died.
</p>
<p>Igor, son of Rurik, now came to power. In 903 he had married Olga, a maiden famed
for wit and beauty, and said to be the daughter of that Gostomyal who first proposed
the election of Rurik. Igor’s reign had no such importance as that of his predecessor.
In 941, after twenty-nine years of waiting, he made an attack on the Byzantine Empire.
This attack was a failure; a mere remnant of warriors came home from it, and those
brought no booty with them.
</p>
<p>Igor resolved to find a cure for this failure, and set out for Tsargrad in 944, three
<span class="corr" id="xd32e481" title="Source: year">years</span> later. He went by sea, with a numerous army collected from all tribes between Lake
Ladoga and the Euxine, including even Petchenegs of the southern steppe land.
</p>
<p>The Greek Emperor sent envoys to Igor, and as he sailed near the coast they met him
north of the Danube, where they delivered rich presents. “Go no farther,” said they
to him. “Take the same that Oleg took, even more will be given thee.” Advised by his
attendants, Igor accepted the offer, and the following year envoys were sent by him
to make a treaty of commerce at Tsargrad. The treaty was made and the Emperor gave
oath to observe it, then he sent envoys to Kief and Igor took the oath. Those of his
men who were pagans swore by Perun, the god of thunder, and by their weapons; those
who were Christians gave oath in the church of Elias. This treaty, more favorable
to the Greeks than that made with Oleg, contains the phrase “Russian land,” used <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>then for the first time in history. Toward the end of that same year, 945, Igor went
to the Drevlians, a forest tribe in the North-west, to collect tribute a second time.
Learning of his approach, the Drevlians counseled together and said: “If a wolf attacks
sheep he will devour the whole flock, unless he is killed; so this man will ruin us,
unless we destroy him.” They seized Igor, bent down two trees, tied his feet to the
top of one and his head to the other, then let them go; thus he was torn asunder.
</p>
<p>The Drevlians then sent envoys to Olga to justify their action, and propose that she
should marry their prince. Olga, determined to avenge her husband, answered: “Your
speech is pleasing to me. To-morrow I will receive you in the presence of all my people.
When my messengers come in the morning, tell them that you will not go on horseback
or on foot,—that you must be carried in your boats.” When the envoys were gone, Olga
had a deep pit dug in the courtyard. Next morning she sent for her guests, who came
in their boats borne on the shoulders of men. The Drevlians, from their lofty position,
looked down proudly on the multitude; but when they arrived at the courtyard they,
with their boats, were thrown into the pit and quickly covered with earth.
</p>
<p>Olga, keeping secret what had taken place, sent for a guard of honor to conduct her
to the Drevlians. The first men of the tribe came; these she had burned up in a bath-house.
Then she sent a message, saying: “I am on the road. Bring as much mead as you can
to where my husband died. I wish to weep over his grave.” She came, with a part of
her army, to where Igor was buried, and there she had a great mound raised, and celebrated
the funeral feast. The Drevlians asked, “Where are our men?” She replied, “They are
coming with my men.” The simple foresters, satisfied with this answer, went on feasting.
When they had drunk themselves into helplessness, Olga’s warriors fell upon them and
slew great numbers.
</p>
<p>This vengeful widow next attacked Korosten. Unable to take it by force, she destroyed
it by cunning. She sent a message to the inhabitants saying: “You have neither mead
nor skins in abundance; give me a tribute of three pigeons, and as many sparrows from
each house, and I will leave you in peace.” The Drevlians, pleased with this moderation,
sent the birds at once. When evening came, Olga had rags steeped in oil tied to their
wings <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>and ignited. The terrified creatures, set free, flew to their cots and nests, and
soon every house in Korosten was in flames. The inhabitants, rushing out of the place,
were either killed or captured. This was a victory of far-reaching importance, for
had Olga failed to conquer the Drevlians, other tribes would have revolted, and Kief
would have been lost.
</p>
<p>Olga ruled wisely and firmly till 957, when Sviatoslav, her only son, reached manhood
and succeeded his father; then she made a journey to Tsargrad, became a Christian
and was baptized under the name of Helen, the Greek Emperor being her godfather. It
is said that upon her return she strove to introduce Christianity into Russia, but
was unsuccessful, mainly because of her son’s opposition. She, however, remained a
strong advocate of the new faith and has been canonized by the Church, as the first
Russian who ascended to the heavenly kingdom.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav, whose sole delight was in war, began his stormy rule by marching against
the only Slavs east of the Dnieper, who paid him no tribute, the tribe of the Vyatichi.
They were at that time tributary to the Kazars, a tribe that had issued from Northern
Asia and were known to the Armenian historians as early as the second century. In
the ninth century they were familiar to the Byzantines as the Eastern Turks; by the
eighth century they had gained the greater part of Tauris, the present Crimea. It
is not known when they first met the Slavs, but in the middle of the ninth century
four Slav tribes paid tribute to the Kazars. The Kazan state itself was a composite
one with four religious systems, Paganism, Mohammedanism, Judaism and Christianity.
The Khan was converted to Judaism in the eighth century, and in a letter written by
Khan Joseph to a Rabbi in Bagdad, he claimed to be ruler over nine nations of the
Caucasus and thirteen near the Black Sea.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav attacked Sarkel on the Don, the chief western town and fortress of the
Kazars, and captured it. Then he marched eastward to the Volga, and sailed down the
river to Itil, the Kazar capital, near the northern shore of the Caspian. Itil, and
all the towns of that region, were seized and plundered. Next the Russian prince marched
to the foot of the Caucasus, and turned westward toward the Azoff, or “Sea Bend,”
as the Russians call it. He overcame all forces that met him on the way, and established
Tmutarakan, <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>with its capital at the Greek town Tamatarche, between the Azoff and the Euxine.
</p>
<p>On his journey home from this long expedition, Sviatoslav finished what he undertook
when he started: he subjected the Vyatichi on the <span class="corr" id="xd32e503" title="Source: Okà">Oká</span>, and forced them to pay tribute. At this juncture the Greek Emperor, Nikifor, threatened
on one side by the Bulgarians and on the other by the Arabs, sent envoys to Sviatoslav
with much gold and many promises. “Let the Russian prince attack the Bulgarians,”
said the envoys. “Let him take their land, let him keep it if he wishes.” Following
this suggestion, Sviatoslav, in 967, overran the greater part of Bulgaria, and wished
to remain in the country, taking Pereyaslavets on the Danube as his capital.
</p>
<p>But while Sviatoslav was ruling Bulgaria from his place on the Danube, the Petchenegs,
who had hitherto been kept down by the Kazars, rushed to Kief and laid siege to it
so closely that no man could enter the city or leave it. At last means were found
to inform Sviatoslav, who hurried home with men and scattered the besiegers, driving
them far out into the steppe. Olga, his mother, then in old age, died three days after
his coming.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav now instated his sons as princes in Russia. He established his eldest son,
Yaropolk, in Kief; his second son, Oleg, he sent to the Drevlians; Vladimir, the third
and youngest son, went to Novgorod at the request of its citizens, who were advised
by Dobrinya, his uncle, to demand him of his father.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav, now free, went back to Bulgaria, but he did not meet the same fortune
as before. The Bulgarians received him with weapons in their hands and gave battle
immediately, but they were defeated, after a desperate struggle, and their town was
taken by storm. Then appeared a far more formidable enemy, the Byzantine Emperor,
John Zimisces, with an overwhelming army. The Russians were terrified, but Sviatoslav
strengthened them, saying: “We have no escape. Whether we will or not, it has come
to us to stand against the Greeks. Let us not bring an evil name upon the Russian
land, but leave our bones upon the field; for the dead there is no disgrace. If we
flee we shall find no hiding-place from our shame. Stand firmly together!”
</p>
<p>A mighty struggle began. According to the Greeks, the Russians were overcome; according
to the Russians, the Greeks yielded. <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>Whoever gained the victory, Sviatoslav, before leaving Bulgaria, concluded a treaty
by which he agreed not to attack Byzantine territory or permit others to do so. The
Emperor sent rich gifts to Sviatoslav and had an interview with him, evidently thinking
the friendship of such a man better than his enmity.
</p>
<p>Then Sviatoslav set out for Kief, sailing down the Danube and along the Black Sea
to the mouth of the Dnieper, which he ascended to the cataracts. There the Petchenegs,
informed by the Bulgarians of his coming, defeated his army and killed him. It is
stated that the Petcheneg chief had a drinking-cup made of Sviatoslav’s skull and
ornamented with this motto: “In striving for what belonged to another, thou hast lost
thy own.” Thus ended the life of a man who was, without doubt, the greatest warrior
amongst the descendants of Rurik.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav was of medium height, robust, with broad breast, blue eyes and flat nose.
He wore long moustaches and had a tuft of hair on the crown of his shaven head as
a mark of his nobility. Nestor describes him as being a man of honor who, when about
to make war on a people, always forewarned them by the words: “I march against you!”
</p>
<p>There was now, for the first time since the death of Rurik’s brothers, a number of
princes, descendants of Rurik, in Russia. From 864 to 972, somewhat more than a century,
there had been single rule all the time, but from 972 to 1480, that is, to the victory
of Moscow over the principalities and over the Mongols, a period of five hundred years,
there was, with only two intervals, a continual struggle between princes for supreme
power.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav’s three sons were born of different mothers and were soon brought to enmity
by advisers. As the tale runs, Svainald, an old warrior who had served the two preceding
princes, was the counsellor and confidant of Yaropolk. Lyut, the son of this confidant,
while hunting in a forest, encroached on Oleg’s territory, and was killed by the order
of that prince. Svainald, to avenge his son’s death, incited Yaropolk against Oleg,
and two years after the death of Lyut, Yaropolk invaded Oleg’s land and defeated him.
While trying to escape Oleg fell from a bridge before Ovrutch and was crushed to death
by his fleeing warriors, who fell on him. When the corpse was brought before Yaropolk,
he was grieved and wept over it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>Vladimir, on hearing in Novgorod of the battle near Ovrutch and the death of Oleg,
fled to foreign parts, but returned three years later bringing with him strong forces.
</p>
<p>Yaropolk, meanwhile, had made himself master in Russia, and, living in Kief, ruled,
through a lieutenant, or posadnik, in Novgorod. Vladimir and his uncle expelled this
posadnik straightway, and sent these words by him to Yaropolk: “Vladimir is marching
against thee. Be ready for battle!”
</p>
<p>The brothers now prepared to struggle for mastery. They began these preparations by
searching out accessions of strength wherever they could find them. Southwest of Novgorod
and northwest of Kief was the principality of Polotsk, which included the whole Dvina
region, at that time ruled by Rogvolod, a man not of Rurik’s descendants, or family.
This prince had a daughter, Rognyeda, betrothed then to Yaropolk. Vladimir, at the
instance of Dobrinya his uncle and adviser, sent envoys to ask for this princess.
This marriage would bring with it the assistance of Rogvolod.
</p>
<p>Rogvolod had no wish to refuse, but he would not consent. When pressed for an answer,
he referred the affair to his daughter.
</p>
<p>Rognyeda was very fond of her betrothed husband, and having no thought at that time
for policy, she replied that she would not marry the son of a bondslave. Vladimir
was the son of Malusha, housekeeper of the great princess Olga,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e526src" href="#xd32e526">3</a> his grandmother, that “wisest of women;” Dobrinya, Vladimir’s counsellor and uncle,
was Malusha’s brother and a bondman. He had already, with wise advice and assistance,
won Novgorod for his nephew, and was now striving to win all Russia.
</p>
<p>Enraged at Rognyeda’s taunt regarding his sister, Dobrinya gave answer not in words,
but in action. Vladimir, following his uncle’s counsel, attacked Rogvolod straightway,
killing him and his two sons in battle. He then took Rognyeda, and with her Polotsk,
which he joined to his own lands. Vladimir’s next step was taken against Yaropolk,
who shut himself up in his capital, which he had meanwhile strengthened.
</p>
<p>Yaropolk’s chief counsellor in Kief was one Blud, a man who in reality wished for
Vladimir’s success, and worked well in secret to help him. Vladimir now laid siege
to Kief. After the siege <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>had gone on for a time, Blud proved to Yaropolk that treason was rife in the capital,
and prevailed on the prince to withdraw in the night-time to Rodnya. This place was
invested soon after so closely and suffered such famine that the phrase “Misery of
Rodnya” was current for a long time in Russia. In these straits, Blud advised agreement
with Vladimir, and Yaropolk set out for his brother’s headquarters, where the meeting
was to take place, but when near the door of his tent, two Varangians with sharp swords
sprang from behind it, and hewed the man’s head off.
</p>
<p>Vladimir was now master. He was one of those powerful, determined characters who found
primitive states: large in person, self-willed, shrewd, with strong impulses and limitless
activity.
</p>
<p>Russia was pagan at that time, but there were a few Christians in Kief, and some writers
think Yaropolk himself was on that side. In that case, Vladimir’s triumph over his
brother was in the first instance a victory for primitive ideas. At all events, there
came in with Vladimir a greater activity in the ancient religion, and for some time
the new prince was its leader. After he began to reign rich statues of the gods were
set up, sacrifices were more frequent and much energy was displayed in order to give
the paganism of the Slavs a dignity and significance equal to that of the religions
by which it was surrounded.
</p>
<p>Though the tribes inhabiting Russia had the same pagan religion, there were many local
variations. It was a religion in a more elementary stage than that of the Aryan settlers
of India, when the earliest Vedas were composed. It was simply an aggregation of beliefs,
superstitions, customs and festivals; the elements of religion not yet grown into
a system.
</p>
<p>Vladimir saw at last that a new religion was necessary to consolidate the tribes under
his rule. His efforts to create one were in vain, for he could no more have created
a religion by edict than he could have so created a language. They are both growths
requiring time and certain processes. Convinced of this fact, all that was left to
the Russian prince was to change the religion of the country to one of those by which
he was surrounded, and this he resolved to do immediately. In religion Vladimir’s
action resembled that of Peter, Russia’s modern industrial reformer, who, some centuries
later, feeling that Russia must use the appliances <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>and methods of modern activity, or others would use them against her, strove to introduce
them himself. Vladimir determined to find a religion himself, to bring it in himself,
so that no power outside might be master in Russia by means of it.
</p>
<p>The account of this conversion is so characteristic that I have translated it from
Nestor, the first Russian chronicler. He says: “About this time different missionaries
came to Vladimir. First the Mohammedans in 986, and they said: ‘You are wise and full
of judgment, but you do not know the law. Believe in our law, and revere Mohammed.’
Vladimir asked: ‘What is your faith?’ ‘We believe in God, and Mohammed teaches us,
saying: “Do not eat pork, do not drink wine.” Mohammed will give each man seventy
wives.’ Vladimir listened, for he was a lover of women, and for him it was pleasant
to hear this, but he did not like to hear of the prohibition of wine and of pork,
and he said: “In Russia, wine is gladness; we cannot get on without that.”
</p>
<p>“Afterward the Germans came, saying: ‘We are from the Pope, and this is his message:
“Thy land is like our land, but thy faith is not like our faith.<span class="corr" id="xd32e545" title="Not in source">”</span> Our faith is light, and we bow down before God, who made the heavens and the earth,
the stars and the moon, and created every breathing thing; but your gods are of wood.’
</p>
<p>“Vladimir then asked: ‘What are your commandments?’ And they answered: ‘Fasting in
proportion to a man’s power, but if any one eats or drinks let it be for the glory
of God, as our teacher, Paul, declared.’ Then Vladimir said to the Germans: ‘Go your
way; our fathers did not receive this law.<span class="corr" id="xd32e549" title="Source: ”">’</span>
</p>
<p>“The Jews, hearing of these missions, came and said: ‘We have learned that Mohammedans
and Christians have come, each teaching his own faith. Him in whom the Christians
believe we crucified. We believe in the one God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’
Vladimir asked: ‘What is your law<span class="corr" id="xd32e554" title="Source: ,">?</span>’ and they said: ‘To be circumcised; not to eat pork or rabbits; to observe the Sabbath.’
Then he asked: ‘But where is your land?’ ‘In Jerusalem.’ ‘Is it indeed there?’ They
answered: ‘God became angry with our fathers and scattered them through the nations
on account of our sins, and our land was given to the Christians.’ Then Vladimir asked:
‘How is it that you teach others when you are yourselves outcasts rejected of God?
If God loved you and <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>your law, he would not have scattered you through strange lands. Do you think to bring
this evil on us, too?’
</p>
<p>“Then the Greeks sent a philosopher to Vladimir, who told him that the Mohammedans
defiled the earth, that they were cursed above all people, and were like the inhabitants
of Sodom and Gomorrah, whom God destroyed with fire from heaven and overwhelmed in
the Dead Sea. That a like day of destruction awaits the Mohammedans when the Lord
shall come to judge the earth and destroy all who work unlawful things. Vladimir said:
‘The Jews came to me and declared that the God of the Greeks and the Germans is the
man whom they crucified.’ The philosopher replied: ‘That was foretold by the Prophets.
The Lord took upon Himself death by the cross at the hands of the Jews, and arose
from the dead on the third day and ascended into heaven. To His executioners forty-six
years were given for repentance, but not repenting, the Romans were sent against them
to destroy their cities and scatter them over the face of the earth, where they now
wander.’ Vladimir asked: ‘For what cause did God come down upon the earth and suffer
such torments?’ The philosopher replied: ‘If you wish, I will tell you all from the
beginning.’ Vladimir answered: ‘I am glad to listen.’ And the Greek told him all from
the creation of the world.
</p>
<p>“In 987 Vladimir called a council composed of his chief men and the elders of the
towns and said to them: ‘The Mohammedans came to me, saying: ‘Receive our law;’ then
the Germans came and praised their law. Afterward came the Jews, and last the Greeks,
with other laws; all praised their own faith. The Greeks explained everything from
the beginning of the world, and spoke with great skill. It was wonderful to hear them
and pleasant to listen to their words. They say there is another world, and whoever
accepts their faith, after he dies he will rise from the dead, and then he shall not
die again forever; but he who receives another law will burn in fire in the other
world. To which do you give your mind?’ They answered: ‘You know, Prince, that no
one belittles his own, but praises it. If you wish to know all religions well, you
have men, send them to examine the religion of each country, and how each people serve
God.’
</p>
<p>“Their speech was pleasing to the prince, and to the people. They chose good and sensible
men, ten in number, and said to them, <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>‘Go first to the Mohammedans and try their religion.’ They went and saw the foul deeds
of the Mohammedans, and came home. Then Vladimir said: ‘Go to the Germans, and also
to Tsargrad.’ After visiting the Germans, they arrived at Tsargrad and stood before
the Tsar. He asked the cause of their coming, and they told him all that had happened.
The Tsar was rejoiced, and showed them great honor that day. Next morning there was
a patriarchal service. A deacon was placed near the envoys to explain the worship
of God, and they wondered greatly, and marveled, praising the service.
</p>
<p>“Upon their return to Kief, Vladimir called together his chief men, with the elders
of the towns, and said: ‘Behold, the men whom we sent have returned to us. Let us
hear what has taken place. Let it be spoken before the warriors.’ The envoys said:
‘We went to the Mohammedans, we saw how they prayed in the mosques, without girdles,
and how, having bowed down, they looked on one side and on the other like madmen.
There is no joy in their temples, but sadness and great uncleanness. Their law is
not good. We went to the Germans and saw much ceremony in their churches; then we
went to the Greeks, and when they led us into the place where they serve their God,
we knew not whether we were in heaven, or upon earth, for in the world there is not
such a sight, or such beauty. We know not how to describe it, we only know that it
is there that God meets man. Their service is beyond the service of all lands. We
are not able to forget that beauty. A man who has tasted the sweet will not afterward
accept the bitter, hence we do not wish to remain where we are!’
</p>
<p>“Then the chief men said to Vladimir: ‘If the law of the Greeks were bad your grandmother
Olga would not have received it, for she was the wisest among men.’ Vladimir asked:
‘Where shall we receive baptism?’ And they answered: ‘Where it pleaseth thee.’ ”
</p>
<p>While Vladimir had decided to embrace Christianity, he had resolved at the same time
to avoid even the semblance of moral subjection to any foreign power. He therefore
set about acquiring religion by conquest. For that purpose he led an expedition against
the Crimea and captured Kerson,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e570src" href="#xd32e570">4</a> the capital of the ancient republic <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>of that name, and at that time the most flourishing city on the northern coast of
the Black Sea. Then he sent a message to the Greek Emperors, demanding their sister
Anna in marriage. They answered that their sister could not marry a pagan. Vladimir
replied that religion could be no bar, for he had long since made up his mind not
only to receive Christianity himself, but to introduce it into his domains, and if
the requisite number of priests were sent in the suite of the princess there need
be no delay, but that if they did not consent to his proposal, he would march on Tsargrad,
and treat it as he had treated Kerson. This threat had the desired effect, for at
that time the Eastern Empire was torn with civil war. The Emperors hastened to avert
the chance of Vladimir’s favoring their enemies, and sent the Princess Anna to Kerson.
A large number of church dignitaries accompanied her. Vladimir, with his whole army,
was baptized and the marriage was celebrated without delay. A part of the Russian
force was despatched to assist the Emperors, and Vladimir returned to Kief, after
restoring Kerson as a friendly gift to his brothers-in-law.
</p>
<p>On his arrival at Kief, the newly converted prince overturned the ancient idols. Some
were cut into pieces, others were cast into the fire, but the statue of Perun (the
Vedic Parjana), the god of thunder, the Slavonic Jupiter, was tied to the tails of
horses and dragged from its height to the river. Twelve men were sent to beat it with
sticks, not because the wood could feel, but to insult the Devil, since by this image
he had seduced man. When dragged to the river the image was hurled into the water,
and Vladimir commanded men to push it out into the current, should it touch the shore
anywhere. It was borne on the stream and carried over the cataracts, and the wind
blew it far away toward the Black Sea.
</p>
<p>Then heralds were sent through the city saying: “Who will not be baptized, be he rich
or poor, he will be hateful to me.” Vladimir went down with all the priests to the
Dnieper. Great multitudes stood in the water, and the priests prayed and baptized
them. Nestor says: “There was joy upon earth and in heaven, for many souls were saved
that day.” After the sacred rite the people went their way, each man to his own home.
In a like manner the inhabitants of each village and settlement were brought to Christianity,
and Vladimir ordered churches to be built on the places where idols had been. After
Kief, the turn came for the tribes east and <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>west, as well as north. In Novgorod, where the old beliefs had their stronghold, the
opposition was greatest, and when the first church was built the people tore it down
straightway, but a skilful mingling of persuasion and force, together with the adhesion
of the more important citizens, carried the day, and all Russia in time became Christian.
Of course paganism lived on for many a year among the common people, as it did in
other countries, and traces of it are still to be found in the folk-songs and different
religious beliefs, survivals which are extremely interesting to the historian and
philosopher.
</p>
<p>This sending of an embassy of wise men to examine and report on various religions,
so that prince and people might have means of making the best choice, was a remarkable
departure from previous methods, and stands quite alone in the history of European
Christianity. It was the exact opposite of the method used south of the Baltic,—a
method which gave such great profit to invaders.
</p>
<p>All Slav tribes between the Elbe and the Nieman, the Baltic and Bohemia lost independence,
language, and race through the method by which Christianity was forced on them by
Germans. If there were men among the conquered and Christianized who escaped, they
were men who made themselves useful as assistant oppressors, and thus were received
into the foreign aristocracy.
</p>
<p>Christianity, introduced first into Kief and then into Novgorod, extended later on
the east and west of the Dnieper till, after Yaroslav’s day, it occupied all regions
held by Russian princes.
</p>
<p>Vladimir had what the Russians love in a man: a broad nature. Occupied with serious
work, he still found time for feasts. The celebration of victories and the consecration
of churches were always accompanied by great banquets. These festivals took the place
of pagan holidays. In all the songs of Vladimir’s time the feasts of the “Bright Sun
of the Russian land” are ever remembered. So firmly did these ballads fix themselves
in the popular mind, that not many years ago Hilferding, the president of the Slavonic
Society at St. Petersburg, collected in the course of two months enough to fill an
octavo volume of eight hundred double columns.
</p>
<p>Vladimir’s rule in Russia was firm and unconquerable; no enemy was able to shake it.
On the east he extended his power to all places reached by the princes before him;
on the west his possessions touched the river San, and included the Dvina region.
It <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>is difficult to overestimate the importance of this remarkable man’s activity, but
it is by his greatest work that Vladimir is best remembered. Before he introduced
Christianity, the different tribes had been held together by merely material bonds;
thenceforth they were united by a common faith. There is no tie so strong as the tie
of faith, and in no country has it shown more strength than in Russia.
</p>
<p>Vladimir died in 1015, leaving twelve sons and also a nephew, <i>or son</i>, namely Sviatopolk. These sons were from various mothers, and great trouble rose
quickly among them. Sviatopolk, whom people called “the sinful son of two fathers,”
could claim Vladimir’s heritage as a nephew of Vladimir, and son of Yaropolk. He was
the only one of the heirs who was in Kief when the prince died, and he claimed the
throne at once by virtue of his seniority.
</p>
<p>Vladimir had preferred two of his younger sons, Boris and Glaib, to the others, partly
it may be because they were better, as he thought, and partly also because they were
born of the Greek princess, Anna, to whom he was married as a Christian. Boris was
perhaps his favorite, and this son he wished to succeed him as Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk looked on himself no doubt as the son of Yaropolk, whom he had reason to
think of as done to death foully by Vladimir. His mother, who not long before his
birth had been the betrothed wife of Yaropolk, may have schooled him touching his
father. Of this we are not informed, though it seems very probable. In every case,
Sviatopolk acted as if moved by keen hatred, though his motive might have been purely
ambition. Acting swiftly, he seized the throne of Kief straightway, summoned the people,
spoke fairly, and gave presents on all sides; then he found men to slay the sons of
Vladimir. First they killed Boris, and then Glaib. Another son fled westward toward
Hungary, but was followed and killed in the Carpathians.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav, Vladimir’s fourth son, was prince in Novgorod. This city had been paying
Kief a yearly tax of two hundred grievens. The tax, paid at all times unwillingly,
was refused altogether during Yaroslav’s rule. Vladimir had been preparing to punish
his son, and force payment on Novgorod, when he died rather suddenly. Yaroslav, to
defend Novgorod against his father, had brought in Varangians to help him. Those men,
as is the <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>wont of such persons, grew insolent quickly and were offensive to Novgorod women.
Certain people rose up and slew some of those warriors. Yaroslav, to defend his men,
put to death the offenders. The very night after this deed, a message came to the
prince from his sister, Predslava, in Kief, giving notice of the death of his father
and of all that had happened in the city.
</p>
<p>Next morning Yaroslav summoned the people of Novgorod, and with tears in his eyes
made this speech to them: “If I could, I would raise up with gold those men who fell
yesterday. My father is dead, and now Sviatopolk is master. He is killing my brothers.
Give me help to meet Sviatopolk and avenge these murders.”
</p>
<p>“Though some of our brothers are dead, we have men enough yet to stand up and fight
for thee,” said the people of Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk, taking all of his own warriors and many Petchenegs, hurried northward
to strike down Yaroslav if possible. The two armies met near Lubetch, and Yaroslav
gained a great victory.
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk fled to Poland, where his wife’s father, Boleslav the Brave, was then sovereign,
and Yaroslav marched into Kief, and began rule there. The Polish king took the part
of his son-in-law, and after various efforts, in which Petchenegs of the steppe were
on Sviatopolk’s side, and Henry of Germany on Yaroslav’s, Boleslav, adding to his
own men German and Hungarian mercenaries, led in a great force against Kief, defeated
Yaroslav, and the fratricide was in power again. The king now sent home one half of
his army, but lingered behind with the rest of it, which was scattered about for subsistence
in different towns and villages. Sviatopolk soon tired of his ally, and then the people
on whom Boleslav’s warriors were quartered rose up and slew many of them. The Polish
king left at last, bearing with him much treasure. On the way to his own lands, he
took Galitch<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e604src" href="#xd32e604">5</a> as the price for ridding Kief of his presence. No sooner was Boleslav fairly at home,
than a fierce northern storm rushed down upon Sviatopolk.
</p>
<p>Expecting no good to their city from Sviatopolk the Accursed, who would surely exact
the old tribute, the Novgorod people rallied round Yaroslav, and, hiring foreign troops,
took the field themselves. Sviatopolk was beaten in the first battle, and fled to
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>the Petchenegs, from whom he obtained a large army. A second battle was fought and,
as fate would have it, at the place where Boris had been slain. Three times the armies
paused in the struggle, and three times they closed in mortal combat, but, before
the sun went down, Yaroslav had become master of the field. This battle ruined Sviatopolk.
He fled straightway toward the Polish boundary, and after miserable wanderings perished.
It is unknown where death came to him, or in what manner.
</p>
<p>Of Vladimir’s twelve sons, only three were now living, Yaroslav, Mystislav, and Sudislav.
There was also a nephew, Bryacheslav. The throne of Kief came to Yaroslav without
a rival, for since Bryacheslav’s father had never sat on the throne, his son could
not hold it. Mystislav and Sudislav were younger brothers and were excluded till Yaroslav’s
death, unless he should give place to them. Younger brothers, however, claimed equal
shares in the common inheritance, but these were held back by Yaroslav. He kept for
himself the shares of his brothers who were dead, and gave nothing to the survivors.
</p>
<p>The youngest, Sudislav, took no action, but Mystislav came promptly from Tmutarakan
with an army to ask for the share that belonged, as he thought, to him. While Yaroslav
was absent in Novgorod, Mystislav appeared before Kief, but the people there closed
the gates firmly against him. He went then to Chernigoff and took it. Yaroslav hired
warriors immediately, and with them and those he already had set out to find and punish
Mystislav.
</p>
<p>The two brothers met at Listven, somewhat west of <span class="corr" id="xd32e615" title="Source: Cheringoff">Chernigoff</span>, where Mystislav made an attack. He forced the battle at night during a terrible
thunder-storm, and, knowing his ground well, defeated Yaroslav, who fled to Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Though Mystislav had won, he sought only that which he held to be his own, and which
he had demanded at first; he would not take Kief from an elder brother. He sent this
message to Yaroslav: “Remain in thy Kief. Give me what is east of the Dnieper.” On
that basis they settled, and the following year Yaroslav entered Kief with a large
army.
</p>
<p>Mystislav of Chernigoff had one son, who died in 1032. He himself died in 1035, while
out hunting.
</p>
<p>Sudislav, Yaroslav’s youngest brother, ruled in Pskoff and did nothing to win more
dominion. But in 1035, Yaroslav put him <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>in prison and kept him there. The chronicler states that men calumniated Sudislav,
asserting that he was dissatisfied at not receiving a share in the lands of his dead
brothers. The nephew, Bryacheslav of Polotsk, was more fortunate; he made himself
unendurable, nay, dangerous, and, in view of this, Yaroslav added to Polotsk the two
cities of Vitebsk and Usvyat.
</p>
<p>While ruling in Novgorod, Yaroslav had struggled against tribute to Kief. Now, as
Grand Prince, he gave that city a charter of freedom from tribute, and sent there
as prince Vladimir, his eldest son. When Vladimir died, some two years later, he sent
Izyaslav, another son. Because of these sons, Yaroslav quarreled with Kosnyatin, his
grand-uncle, son of Dobrinya. We have seen how Dobrinya, the uncle of Vladimir, had
made this son of Malusha, his sister, prince in Novgorod, and somewhat later Grand
Prince of Russia.
</p>
<p>Kosnyatin was a man of distinction in Novgorod, who fought devotedly for Yaroslav
during his struggles with Sviatopolk. Kosnyatin was now imprisoned by Yaroslav, who
put him to death two years later. The cause of this seemingly ungrateful treatment
is not known, but doubtless Kosnyatin, demanding too much for himself and for Novgorod,
opposed the prince as energetically as he had formerly fought for him. In other words,
he encroached on the sovereignty of Yaroslav, and his actions became of the kind which
rulers of states treat as criminal, and which they meet with one answer at all times
and places,—that answer is permanent removal.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav the Lawgiver, the man who completed the foundation of the ancient Russian
state, ascended the throne in 1016 and ruled for thirty-eight years. This was the
most prosperous period of ancient Russia. The hordes of the steppes were kept in subjection,
and about one third of Finland added to Russia, who thus held both sides of the water
highway on the north. But Yaroslav’s claims to the title of a great ruler rest on
another basis. He was a legislator, an administrator, a founder of cities. He framed
the first code of laws, the famous Russkaya Pravda, or Russian Right; he carried on
the most orderly government known till that day. In the restoration of boundaries
and in internal improvements his activity was not less important. He recovered Galitch,
which Boleslav of Poland had seized on his way home from his <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>campaign with Sviatopolk the Accursed. He founded many towns and cities, two of which
are well known in our time, Yaroslavl on the Volga, and Yurieff, now Dorpat. Wishing
Kief to rival Tsargrad, he spent much of the revenue exacted from tributary peoples
in adorning his capital. He established the first school in the north, at Novgorod,
a school for three hundred students. He concluded more alliances and maintained a
more extended intercourse with European sovereigns than any prince of ancient Russia.
His later wars were mostly with the Petchenegs, those robbers of the steppe who had
made a drinking-cup of his grandfather’s skull, and he at last succeeded in crushing
them so completely that they never again took up arms against him, and even their
name finally disappeared. All his children were from one mother, Ingigerd of Sweden.
One of his daughters married King Andrew of Hungary; another became the wife of Harold
Hardrada, King of Norway; a third, Anna, married Henry&nbsp;I of France and took with her
the beautiful missal afterwards used in the Cathedral of Rheims at the coronation
of the French kings. When Peter the Great visited that city in 1717, the missal was
shown him as of the rarest antiquity, no one even knowing the language in which it
was written. To the astonishment of all present, the Emperor exclaimed: “Why, this
is my own Slavonic,” and he began to read in a loud voice. This missal, a masterpiece
of penmanship, and one of the most ancient specimens of Slavonic writing, was copied
no doubt under the supervision of Yaroslav himself.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav died in 1054. He was not such a favorite with the multitude as his father,
Vladimir, had been. He was more austere in character, a subtle-brained ruler of men,
wise and far-seeing, but unbending, better fitted to inspire respect than love. The
chronicler says of him: “Yaroslav was in his place. He was lame, but his mind was
not halt. He was brave in war, he was a Christian, and read books.” He built many
churches, among them Saint Sophia, the admiration of Kief, and Saint Sophia of Novgorod,
a precious monument of ancient Russia.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav, knowing well the evils of civil war, arranged the succession as follows.
The eldest son was to rule at Kief, with the title of Grand Prince; the other sons
were to have each a principality, proportioned in accordance to his age. On the death
of the Prince of Kief, he was to be succeeded by his next brother, who, <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>on his decease, would be followed by the next to him, and so on to the youngest, whose
heir was the eldest son of the eldest brother, or first Prince of Kief. In the second
generation, the succession was to continue as in the first. This system was evidently
copied from that of the Slavonic households, where it might operate well enough, because
a younger brother held no position during the life of the elder. But in the ruling
family each member governed a certain territory, and when the Prince of Kief died,
there was a change all around, each ruler moving a step higher in the scale. The result
was continual shifting, disorder, and civil war.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav left five sons, and a number of grandsons, whose fathers were dead. To the
sons he gave principalities; to the grandsons he left nothing; they must depend upon
the kindness of their uncles; they were really excluded from sovereignty, and became
in fact common people.
</p>
<p>Before death Yaroslav enjoined mutual love on all his sons, and on the younger obedience
to Izyaslav, the eldest, who would be to them in the place of a father. To Izyaslav
he gave Kief, saying to him: “If any of thy brothers offend another, do thou protect
the offended man.”
</p>
<p>Besides Kief, Izyaslav was prince also in Novgorod, hence the road from the Baltic
to the Greeks was at his command.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav, the second son, received Chernigoff with Ryazan, Murom, and Tmutarakan,
beyond the Sea of Azoff. Vsevolod, the third son, received Pereyaslavl, Suzdal and
Bailo-Ozero; the fourth son, Vyacheslav, got Smolensk, and the fifth, Igor, Volynia
with its capital, Vladimir. <span class="corr" id="xd32e641" title="Source: Rostislev">Rostislav</span>, son of Vladimir, Yaroslav’s eldest son, who died before his father, received from
his uncles Rostoff, situated in the middle of Vsevolod’s territory.
</p>
<p>In this division of Russia the best principality, Kief, went to the eldest son; the
second in value, Chernigoff, to the second son, and so on. The idea was to give each
prince a place whose income corresponded to his rank in the scale of seniority. Kief,
besides its superior income, carried with it the sovereignty of Russia.
</p>
<p>Let us follow the working of this system. In 1057, three years after Yaroslav’s death,
died the fourth brother, Vyacheslav of Smolensk, leaving one son. Igor of Volynia
was transferred to Smolensk by his brothers, and Rostislav, the nephew, was <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>moved from Rostoff to Volynia. In 1060 Igor died in Smolensk, leaving sons also. The
remaining three brothers gave Smolensk neither to Igor’s sons, nor to Rostislav, to
whom, by the established order, it would belong.
</p>
<p>Rostislav, enraged at his uncles, found daring spirits in Novgorod to help him, among
others Vyshata, son of Ostromir, the posadnik. With these men he set out for Tmutarakan
to find warriors and win by the sword that which, as he thought, belonged to him.
</p>
<p>In 1058 the four surviving brothers freed their uncle Sudislav from prison, where
Yaroslav, his brother, had kept him for eighteen years. They took from him an oath
to act in no way against them. Old and childless, he entered a monastery, and died
five years later.
</p>
<p>Rostislav now took Tmutarakan from Glaib, son of Sviatoslav. Sviatoslav hurried to
help his son, and, as Rostislav did not resist his uncle, Glaib was put back into
power very promptly. No sooner was Sviatoslav at home, however, than Glaib was driven
out a second time by Rostislav, who now settled down firmly and with a purpose. He
began at once to extend his dominion along the Caucasus, and was rapidly gaining power
to use against his uncles, when the Greeks of the Chersonese poisoned him, and Glaib
took his old place again unhindered.
</p>
<p>The three sons of Yaroslav were rid now of their nephew, but they had a cousin who
began to give them much trouble. This cousin was Vseslav of Polotsk, grandson of Izyaslav,
the eldest brother of Yaroslav the Lawgiver. This Vseslav was known to be desperate
in battle, and swift beyond any man in marching. People believed him born through
enchantment, they thought him a real devil’s son, who could turn to a gray wolf and
race in one night from the Caucasus to Novgorod. This so called “wizard,” excluded
from the sovereign circle, now began war in defense of rights which to him, the great-grandson
of Vladimir the Apostle, might indeed seem well founded.
</p>
<p>In 1065 the wizard attacked Pskoff, meeting with no success, but the following year
he entered Novgorod, captured many people, took down the great bell of Sophia, seized
church ornaments and hurried away. “Immense was the misery of that day,” states the
chronicler. Izyaslav and his brothers pursued Vseslav during terrible cold, for the
time was midwinter. On the road <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>they halted at Minsk. The people had shut themselves up in the stronghold; so they
stormed the stronghold and captured it, cutting down all defenders, sparing only women
and children as captives.
</p>
<p>They followed Vseslav till early in March, when they overtook him, and notwithstanding
a blinding snow-storm, there was a terrible battle. Many fell on both sides. Vseslav
was defeated, but he escaped, as he always did, because of his swiftness and “magic.”
</p>
<p>The following summer, Izyaslav invited the “evil wizard” to a council of peace and
kissed the cross not to harm him. Vseslav, with his two sons, passed over the Dnieper,
but when he entered Izyaslav’s tent he was seized, though a wizard, and imprisoned;
his sons were imprisoned also.
</p>
<p>The Prince of Kief and his brothers had rest now from relatives. But some great calamity
was coming, every one felt it; there were portents on all sides. A bloody star appeared
in the sky and remained a whole month there; the sun was as pale as the moon; a deformed
fish had been caught, enormous and dreadful to look at.
</p>
<p>While all men were convinced that some terror was approaching, and were waiting in
fear to see what it might be, the Polovtsi, a new scourge, appeared. They had conquered
the Petchenegs and were now ready to harass Russia. Kazars, Torks and Petchenegs had
preceded them in this office, but the Polovtsi were Russia’s direst foes thus far.
</p>
<p>In 1055 the Polovtsi had crossed the boundary of Pereyaslavl, but made peace and then
vanished. In 1059 Vsevolod attacked a certain Tork force, which he crushed. In 1060
a “countless host” was led against those Tork opponents, who, informed of the movement,
hurried off to the steppe, but were followed. The princes killed many and seized numbers
more of them. The captives were settled in towns to do service. Those Torks who succeeded
in escaping died in the steppe from frost, hunger and hardship. The Torks were now
finished, as were also the Petchenegs, but the Polovtsi succeeded both, as attackers
of Russia.
</p>
<p>In 1061 these people appeared in large numbers. Vsevolod met them immediately, but
he was vanquished. They took what they pleased and rushed off to the steppe again.
In 1068 a still greater host came. The three Russian princes met this host, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>fought bravely, but were badly defeated and fled, Izyaslav with his brother Vsevolod
to Kief; and Sviatoslav to Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>All men in Kief were enraged at Izyaslav. Some demanded arms, and others a prince
who would lead them successfully against the Polovtsi. They rushed to the prison,
freed Vseslav the wizard, and made him Grand Prince immediately. Izyaslav, to save
his life, hastened westward to Poland. The Polovtsi advanced to Chernigoff, where
Sviatoslav met the plundering host and crushed it.
</p>
<p>Seven months after his flight, Izyaslav appeared before Kief with a numerous army
commanded by Boleslav the Bold, King of Poland. Vseslav went forth to meet him, and
it is told of him that, since he could hope for no favor from Vsevolod or Sviatoslav
against Izyaslav, their brother, the wizard became a gray wolf in the night-time and
vanished. In fact he fled. The army, deserted by its leader, returned to Kief and
sent the following message to Sviatoslav and Vsevolod: “Unless ye save Kief from the
Poles, we will burn it and go to the land of the Greeks.” “We will warn our brother,”
replied Sviatoslav, “we will not permit him to enter the city with large forces.”
</p>
<p>Izyaslav, warned by his brothers, came with only a part of the army, was received
and took his place as of old in the capital. As soon as he left the Kief army, Vseslav
hurried off to Polotsk and took possession of that city.
</p>
<p>Once well reinstated in Kief, Izyaslav attacked Vseslav, <span class="corr" id="xd32e673" title="Source: expeled">expelled</span> him from Polotsk, and placed there Mystislav, his own son. When that son died he
sent another one, Sviatopolk. Vseslav, meanwhile, went to the Chuds (Fins), assembled
a large force among them, and attacked Novgorod, but he was again unsuccessful. Fresh
warriors, however, flocked to the wizard, who drove Sviatopolk from Polotsk, which
he held now successfully, and with firmness.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav, having failed to subdue the wizard, decided to act alone, and negotiate
with him. He asked no aid from his brothers; he could not well do so, for Sviatoslav
the Strong was unfriendly, was in reality plotting against Izyaslav, working to make
himself master of Kief at the earliest moment. Dissatisfied Kief men, and victims
of Izyaslav’s anger, found refuge with Sviatoslav, who turned now to Vsevolod, his
brother, and said: “Izyaslav <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>is plotting with the wizard against us. Unless we expel him from Kief at once, he
will drive us both from our places.” The two brothers took action and Izyaslav was
forced to leave Kief for the second time.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav became Grand Prince and gave Chernigoff to Vsevolod. Izyaslav now went
to Poland. He gave immense presents to Boleslav the Bold and to magnates, who did
naught to assist him, but in the end told him that he would better go elsewhere. He
journeyed then to Mainz and asked aid of Henry&nbsp;IV, the same Emperor who went to Canossa.
He gave presents to Henry and begged help against Sviatoslav and Vsevolod. Henry,
pleased by this recognition of his power by a Grand Prince of Russia, sent an embassy
straightway to Kief to demand reinstatement for Izyaslav.
</p>
<p>The Polish king and Henry were enemies at this time, hence Sviatoslav made a treaty
at once with the king, and sent Oleg, his own son, with Monomach, son of Vsevolod,
to assist him. Henry’s efforts were vain, so Izyaslav’s son visited Rome to beg aid
of Gregory, the seventh of that name, the strong Pope who forced Henry&nbsp;IV to stand
thinly clad in the cold at Canossa.
</p>
<p>The Russian prince declared that his father was ready to recognize papal supremacy,
if Gregory would only restore Kief to him. The Pope wrote at once to the Polish king,
touching the gifts which he had taken from Izyaslav before sending him out of the
country.
</p>
<p>At this juncture Henry’s ally, the Bohemian king, Vratislav, heard that two Russian
princes were coming with warriors to attack him. He asked peace of Boleslav, and obtained
it for one thousand grievens in silver. Boleslav then directed Oleg and Monomach to
return, as peace had been concluded. They replied that they could not go back without
shame, unless they won honor. Hence they advanced to get honor. During four months
they “went through” Vratislav’s land—to “go through” means to ravage. Vratislav then
gave them a thousand grievens in silver for peace. They made peace, and returned home
with the money—and with honor.
</p>
<p>The Polish king, angered by Oleg and Monomach, and roused by Pope Gregory, promised
to help Izyaslav, and began an advance on Kief. Meanwhile Sviatoslav died, and Vsevolod
set out with <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>forces to meet Boleslav, but upon reaching Volynia he made peace, yielding in favor
of Izyaslav, who became Grand Prince for the third time, and Vsevolod returned to
Chernigoff. There was trouble on all sides, however.
</p>
<p>In 1076, during winter, Monomach hastened to Novgorod to help Glaib against Vseslav
the wizard, who was raiding and would give no rest at any time unless that which he
claimed was assured him. Some months later Monomach was joined by his father, Vsevolod,
and they marched against Vseslav, taking with them Polovtsi warriors, employed now
for the first time in conflicts between princes. They made an attack, but could not
crush Vseslav; he was too swift in his movements. They could lay waste to the country,
but could not conquer the wizard, or stop him. They could only watch and then ward
off the blows which he struck at one point or another.
</p>
<p>But from the east still greater troubles were approaching. Vladimir, Sviatoslav, Vyacheslav
and Igor, four sons of Yaroslav, were now dead, all leaving sons to whom their uncles
would give no land. After Sviatoslav’s death in 1076, and when Vsevolod had gone to
meet Izyaslav and yield Kief to him, Boris, a son of Vyacheslav, seized the throne
of Chernigoff, but retained it only eight days. Then he sped away to Tmutarakan, where
Roman, son of Sviatoslav, was ruler. There were five of those sons of Sviatoslav,
who held good lands while their father was Grand Prince, but after his death they
were driven from the lands by Izyaslav, their uncle. Glaib was forced to leave Novgorod
and lost his life in the north among Fins. Oleg, driven from Volynia, turned first
to Vsevolod, his uncle, but when he could get no assistance from him he went to Tmutarakan,
in search of men to aid him. Meanwhile, Izyaslav and Vsevolod gave all disposable
lands to their own sons.
</p>
<p>Two years later, 1078, Oleg and his cousin Boris led an army of Polovtsi and others
to Chernigoff, where they attacked Vsevolod and defeated him. Vsevolod turned then
to Izyaslav for assistance, and the two princes, with Yaropolk and Monomach, their
sons, marched against Oleg and his cousin. Boris was killed in the front of the battle,
and a spear went through the body of Izyaslav, the Grand Prince. Though these two
princes fell, the battle continued till Oleg’s forces were broken and he was swept
from <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>the field, escaping with great difficulty. Thus one son and one grandson of Yaroslav
fell in this desperate struggle between uncles and nephews (October, 1078).
</p>
<p>Now Vsevolod, the last son of Yaroslav the Lawgiver, became Grand Prince, and the
difficulties before him were enormous.
</p>
<p>As already stated, Yaroslav the Lawgiver had six sons: Vladimir, Izyaslav, Sviatoslav,
Vyacheslav, Igor and Vsevolod. Vladimir, the eldest son, had died before his father’s
death, and had left one son, Rostislav, poisoned afterward in Tmutarakan by the Greeks
of Chersonese. Rostislav had three sons: Rurik, Volodar and Vassilko. Rurik died early,
Volodar and Vassilko lived long and caused much trouble.
</p>
<p>Vyacheslav, the fourth son of the Lawgiver, died Prince of Smolensk, leaving one son,
Boris, who fell, as we have seen, on the battle-field with Izyaslav, his uncle. Igor,
the fifth son, had died young, leaving one son, David. Vsevolod, the sixth son, was
now Prince of Russia. Of Sviatoslav’s sons, four were living, Oleg, Roman, David and
Yaroslav. Seven descendants of Yaroslav the Lawgiver were excluded, besides Vseslav,
the wizard of Polotsk, who demanded equal rights with the sons of Yaroslav, and would
not give peace till he got them.
</p>
<p>On assuming power in Kief, Vsevolod gave Chernigoff to his son Monomach, and to Yaropolk,
son of Izyaslav, he gave Volynia. He gave nothing to any of the dissatisfied princes.
This conduct roused Oleg, whose father had been Grand Prince in Kief with the aid
and consent of Vsevolod, given either by constraint or freely. So in 1079 Oleg sent
his brother, Roman, with an army of Polovtsi to war against Vsevolod, who met him,
but made peace with the Polovtsi by giving value in hand without fighting. As Roman
had nothing to give them, save a promise of plunder for which they must fight, the
Polovtsi dropped Roman’s cause and killed him. Then they went home, seized Oleg and
gave him to the Greeks of the Chersonese, who sent him in fetters to Rhodes in the
Archipelago. Ratibor was sent by Vsevolod as posadnik to Tmutarakan, and he ruled
there till David, son of Igor, with Vassilko and Volodar, sons of Rostislav, came
the following year, drove him out of Tmutarakan and governed in their own way. Oleg,
who had fled from his exile, appeared a year later, confined <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>the three princes, and put those Polovtsi to death who slew Roman. Later on he freed
the princes, who had now to seek for lands in other places.
</p>
<p>In 1084 Rostislav’s son’s, Vassilko and Volodar, disappeared from Volynia, where they
had been living with Yaropolk. Disappeared, but returned with an army and drove away
Yaropolk. Monomach now, at command of his father, marched against those two princes,
expelled them and reinstated Yaropolk after much fighting and effort.
</p>
<p>David, son of Igor, used means of another sort. He remained for a time in Tmutarakan,
then he went with warriors to the mouth of the Dnieper, stopped all merchants trading
with Tsargrad and took their wares from them. This put an end to commerce with the
Byzantine Empire. Vsevolod’s treasury suffered immediately and he was obliged to come
to terms. He gave David a part of Volynia, and commerce with Tsargrad was free again.
</p>
<p>Yaropolk, deeply offended by this gift to David, which decreased his own lands, began
to enlist men and make ready for warfare. Vsevolod, upon learning of this, sent his
son, Vladimir Monomach, to attack Yaropolk, but that prince had fled to Poland, leaving
wife, mother and treasures in Lutsk. An attack was made upon Lutsk, which surrendered
to Monomach, who captured Yaropolk’s family with attendants and treasures and established
David, son of Igor, as ruler of all Volynia.
</p>
<p>At this time Galitch was won, as it seems, by the sons of Rostislav. They seized it
from the Polish king, who was friendly with Yaropolk.
</p>
<p>The following year, 1086, Yaropolk came back from Poland, made peace with Monomach
and was again seated in Volynia. Still his lands could not have been of great use
to him, since soon after his coming he set out for Zvenigorod. He was slain on the
road by a man named Neradets, who escaped and took refuge with Rurik, son of Rostislav,
in Galitch.
</p>
<p>That same year Vsevolod moved against Volodar and Vassilko, but in the end made peace
with them. After that there was rest for a time in Volynia. But there was sharp trouble
with Vseslav the wizard, who at Vsevolod’s accession had “scorched” Smolensk, that
is burned it, all save the stronghold. Monomach <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>hunted him swiftly with men doubly mounted,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e712src" href="#xd32e712">6</a> but the wizard escaped. A second hunt followed, by men from Chernigoff and Polovtsi
allies. On the way they took Minsk by surprise, and left not a man or beast in the
city.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">VLADIMIR MONOMACH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1093 Vsevolod died at the age of sixty-four. His successor was Sviatopolk, son
of Izyaslav, a weak and worthless man. Then came trouble and turmoil. “Those were
days,” an old song says, “when strife was sown, when it grew as grain in the field
grows, when men’s lives were shortened by princes’ struggles, when the cry of the
earth-tiller was heard only rarely, but often the scream of the crows wrangling over
corpses.” Monomach, the bravest and ablest of all the descendants of Yaroslav, might
have taken the Kief throne had he wished, since the Kief people begged him to do so,
but he feared civil war and refused, saying: “Sviatopolk’s father was older than my
father; he reigned first in Kief.”
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk, greedy and cruel, showed his character quickly. Envoys from the Polovtsi
came to sell peace to him. He cast them into prison. When the Polovtsi heard of this
insult they made war with the utmost vigor.
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk then freed the envoys and asked for peace, but could not get it. He began
at once to prepare for war on a small scale, but at last took advice and asked aid
of Monomach, who came, bringing with him his brother. The three princes with their
combined forces attacked the Polovtsi, though Monomach urged peace, since the enemy
outnumbered them notably. The Russians were beaten in a savage encounter and Rostislav,
Monomach’s brother, was drowned while crossing a river; Monomach himself had a narrow
escape when struggling to save him. Elated with triumph, the Polovtsi hastened toward
Kief, ravaging all before them. Sviatopolk, who had taken refuge in the capital, summoned
fresh warriors and went out to meet the enemy a second time, but was again defeated
and fled back to Kief with but two attendants.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>As Sviatopolk now wished greatly for peace, he gave what the Polovtsi asked, and took
the Khan’s daughter in marriage.
</p>
<p>Oleg, son of Sviatoslav of Chernigoff, one of the most resolute and active men of
the eleventh century, came also with peace to sell, leading in a new army of Polovtsi.
The crushing defeats which his cousins had suffered prepared the way for him. He laid
siege to Chernigoff, harried the surrounding country and burned churches and villages.
For eight days his Polovtsi worked at the stronghold, then Monomach sent a message
to Oleg declaring that to stop bloodshed and ruin he would march from the city. Peace
was made on that basis, and Oleg became master of Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>Pereyaslavl was now Monomach’s capital, and continued to be so during a time of sore
trial and waiting. Pereyaslavl was the place which the Polovtsi struck first of all,
when marching against Russia. Monomach lived three years in this exposed capital,
where he suffered through lack of means and from ceaseless attacks of the Polovtsi.
In 1095 two Khans, Itlar and Kitan, came to Pereyaslavl to sell peace, that is to
take treasure for a promise of peace, and then break the promise.
</p>
<p>Itlar went with his men to the stronghold to pass the night there and was lodged at
the house of Ratibor, a distinguished boyar.
</p>
<p>Kitan remained between the outer wall and the second one, and Monomach gave Sviatoslav,
his son, to Kitan as hostage for the safety of Itlar.
</p>
<p>A man by the name of Slavata, who had come that day on some mission from Sviatopolk
in Kief, persuaded Ratibor to get consent from Monomach to kill those Polovtsi. “How
could I permit such a deed?” demanded Monomach; “I have given my oath to Itlar:” “The
Polovtsi give oaths to thee, and then slay and ruin us on all sides. That they will
do this time also.” Monomach yielded after much persuasion, and that night men were
sent out who stole away Sviatoslav and then killed Kitan with his attendants. Itlar,
at Ratibor’s house, knew nothing of what had happened. Next morning Ratibor’s men
climbed to the top of the house in which Itlar was lodging, opened the roof and killed
the Polovtsi warriors with arrows. Sviatopolk and Monomach moved at once to the steppe
against the Polovtsi and sent to Oleg for aid in the struggle. Oleg went, but held
aloof through <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>suspicion. The two princes were successful. The Polovtsi, taken unawares, were badly
defeated. The princes seized men, cattle, horses and camels, and returned home with
rich booty.
</p>
<p>Oleg’s conduct had angered Sviatopolk and Monomach seriously. “Thou art unwilling
to join us against the vile enemy,” said they. “In thy house Itlar’s son is now living;
give him to us, or else kill him.” Oleg would not yield to his cousins. Soon after
they sent this message: “Come to Kief and take counsel, so that we may defend Russia
together.” “I will not let priests and common men judge me,” replied Oleg. This answer
enraged Kief people, and Sviatopolk and Monomach declared war against Oleg without
another question. “Thou wilt not help us to crush pagans,” said they, “or meet us
in council. Thou art plotting to strengthen the enemy. Let God judge between us.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e737src" href="#xd32e737">1</a>
</p>
<p>The two princes now marched on Chernigoff. Oleg fled thence to Starodub and shut himself
in there. The princes laid siege to the place, and during thirty-three days they made
vigorous onsets, but the defense was most resolute. At last the besieged were exhausted,
and Oleg was obliged to beg for peace. “Go to David, thy brother,” replied the princes,
“and come with him to Kief. Kief is the mother city. In Kief ruled our ancestors.
Let us meet there and settle all questions.” Oleg kissed the cross in assent and set
out for Smolensk to find David, but upon arriving at that city the people would not
allow him to enter, so he turned and went back toward Ryazan.
</p>
<p>Since Oleg and David did not come to Kief to make peace and take counsel, the two
princes marched on Smolensk. David now made peace with them, on what terms is unknown
to us, while Oleg, with his own men and some warriors sent him by David in secret,
advanced against Murom to expel Izyaslav, son of Monomach. Izyaslav, having a numerous
force, went out to meet Oleg. “Go to Rostoff, which belonged to thy father,” said
Izyaslav, “but leave my father’s portion.” “I wish to be here,” replied Oleg. Izyaslav
now gave battle. A fierce struggle followed, and Izyaslav fell in the fight before
the walls of Murom. The town then received Oleg, who hurried on straightway to Suzdal,
which also surrendered. Of the citizens some he held captive while others were sent
to various places in his own land, <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>but he seized all of their property. He appeared next in front of Rostoff, which surrendered
at once, and he appointed men to collect taxes there.
</p>
<p>Oleg held now all lands connected with Murom. At this juncture there came to him an
envoy from Mystislav, prince in Novgorod, with this message: “Leave Suzdal and Murom.
Take not another man’s province. I will make peace between thee and my father, even
though thou hast slain Izyaslav, my brother.”
</p>
<p>Oleg would not listen. After such a victory he had no desire for peace. He planned
to take Novgorod, he had even sent forward his brother, Yaroslav, and was going to
assist him. Mystislav sent men, who seized Oleg’s tax-gatherers. In view of this,
Yaroslav warned Oleg to guard himself carefully, that forces were advancing from Novgorod.
Oleg turned back to Rostoff, but Mystislav followed him. He then left Rostoff for
Suzdal; his enemy hurried straight after him. Oleg burned Suzdal and fled to Murom.
Mystislav reached Suzdal and halted. From Suzdal he sent an envoy again to make peace,
if possible.
</p>
<p>Oleg, doubtful of victory through force, now sought it through strategy. He sent back
words of seeming friendliness, and was watchful.
</p>
<p>Mystislav, thinking peace near, quartered most of his warriors at some distance in
villages. While eating at midday, news was brought in that the enemy was advancing
rapidly. Oleg had thought that a sudden feint would put his nephew to flight, but
Mystislav held his ground firmly. He quickly called together all his men, and when
Oleg was drawing near Suzdal, an army was ready for action in front of him. For four
days were the two princes facing each other; neither one saw his way to begin the
hard trial. Meanwhile Monomach was hurrying on reinforcements to Mystislav. These
were Polovtsi commanded by another son, Vyacheslav. On the fifth day Oleg moved against
Suzdal, and Mystislav, having placed the Polovtsi in ambush to attack at the critical
moment, marched out to meet him.
</p>
<p>The battle began, and Mystislav with his Novgorod men was bearing down heavily on
the enemy, when the Polovtsi, with Monomach’s banner above them, suddenly rushed at
the flank of Oleg’s army. Panic fell on the warriors at sight of that banner; <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>they thought that Monomach was attacking in person, and they fled from the field in
disorder.
</p>
<p>Oleg escaped to Murom, where he left his brother, Yaroslav, and then marched with
all speed to Ryazan. Mystislav hastened to <span class="corr" id="xd32e755" title="Source: Muron">Murom</span>, made peace with the people and freed the men seized by Oleg some time earlier, then
he pursued Oleg farther. Oleg, learning that Mystislav was approaching, left Ryazan.
Mystislav came to terms with the people of Ryazan, as he had with those of Murom.
He now sent a second letter to Oleg, urging him to make peace with his cousins. Oleg
made a favorable promise, and Mystislav wrote to Monomach on behalf of Oleg, who was
his godfather. Because of this letter Monomach, anxious to put an end to the dispute
between the princes, sent a mild, but firm message to Oleg. The result was a meeting
of the princes in 1097 at Lubetch, a place east of the Dnieper on the land of Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>Seated on the same carpet, they agreed that in order to put an end to civil war, each
prince, or group of princes, should receive the land held by his, or their father.
Hence Sviatopolk received Kief with Turoff; to Vladimir went all that Vsevolod, his
father, had held,—Smolensk with Rostoff and its settlements. Novgorod fell to Mystislav,
who had conquered Oleg; Sviatoslav’s sons, Oleg, David, and Yaroslav, received the
lands of Chernigoff. There now remained the izgoi, or orphans, the excluded princes:
David, son of Igor, with Vassilko and Volodar, sons of Rostislav. To David was given
Volynia, or all that was left of it after the paring of land from that province. Peremysl
fell to Volodar, and Terebovl to Vassilko.
</p>
<p>When everything was thus amicably settled, the princes kissed the cross, and declared
that if any one of them should raise hands on another all the rest would oppose that
man, and the holy cross be against him. After that they kissed one another and parted.
</p>
<p>This meeting at Lubetch fixed succession to lands east of the Dnieper by giving what
the father had held to the sons of Sviatoslav. But west of that river were, as we
shall find, fruitful causes of trouble. In Polotsk was Vseslav, the restless wizard,
unrecognized as yet, and dissatisfied. In Volynia was David, son of Igor; next to
him were the sons of Rostislav, who had some land which David looked on as a part
of Volynia. Vassilko, Prince of Terebovl, <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>was renowned for his activity and enterprise. He had led Polovtsi into Poland and
was planning new exploits. Warriors from various tribes were coming even then to serve
under him. David, perfidious and grasping, but no warrior, was in ceaseless dread
of Vassilko. Before the council at Lubetch was ended, Turijak, Vassili, and Lazar,
three men of David’s escort, had persuaded their master that Monomach and Vassilko
had formed a plan and were ready for action against him. Vassilko, they said, was
to take Volynia, David’s land, while Monomach would seize Kief from Sviatopolk. This
tale threatened David with loss of rule, and death or exile. He knew well what wandering
and seeking for power meant, so on the way back to Kief he explained this tale to
Sviatopolk, and added: “Unless we seize Vassilko at once, thou wilt not stay in Kief,
nor I in Volynia.” Since Sviatopolk was doubtful as to the truth of this statement,
David developed his reasons for making it: “He killed thy brother Yaropolk, and is
now plotting against both of us; he is at one with Monomach.”
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk was willing to have the deed done, but wished to make David entirely responsible
for it. “If thou art speaking the truth,” said he, “God Himself will be witness on
thy side. If untruth, He will judge thee.”
</p>
<p>When Vassilko reached Kief he was invited by Sviatopolk to the feast of his name’s
day, but he excused himself, saying that his men had gone ahead and he must overtake
them. On hearing this, David sent word to Vassilko as follows: “Offend not thy elder
brother, remain for the feast.” Vassilko refused even this request. David turned then
to Sviatopolk, with these words: “Here in thy capital he dares to disregard thee.
What will the man do in his own land? He will take Pinsk and other towns, thou wilt
think of my words then. Send men, seize Vassilko, and give him to me; I will care
for him.”
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk yielded and sent an invitation to Vassilko to visit him at his home: “If
thou wilt not stay for my festival,” said he, “visit me this morning, and sit awhile
with David and me.”
</p>
<p>Vassilko consented and was on the way when a servant who met him gave warning: “Go
not, O prince,” said he; “they will seize thee.” “God’s will be done,” replied Vassilko
and making the sign of the cross, he rode on. Upon his arrival Sviatopolk came to
the door of his palace, and greeted him with great <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>cordiality and kindness. Then David appeared, and Vassilko was invited to breakfast
with his two kinsmen. Presently Sviatopolk withdrew, as if to give orders, and upon
some pretext David followed him. The next moment men rushed into the room, seized
Vassilko and put him in double fetters.
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk now sought the advice of Kief boyars and the clergy. The boyars answered
evasively; the clergy took the side of Vassilko, and begged the Kief prince to free
him. Sviatopolk seemed to waver. “This is all David’s work,” declared he, “I have
no part in it.” David interfered at once, saying: “If thou set him free, we shall
not remain princes.” “He is in thy care then,” replied Sviatopolk, and Vassilko was
given up to David, who straightway had his eyes put out.
</p>
<p>Monomach wept when he heard of the tragedy. “Never before,” cried he, “has such a
deed as this been done in the midst of us.” And at once he sent to Sviatoslav’s sons,
Oleg and David, for aid in chastising the criminal. They came promptly, with forces
to help him. The three princes then sent this query to Sviatopolk<span class="corr" id="xd32e775" title="Not in source">:</span> “Why commit such iniquity; why cast a knife between princes? Why put thy brother’s
eyes out? If he had offended, why not accuse him before us, we would have punished
him if guilty. But tell us now what his fault was, what did he do to thee?”
</p>
<p>“David told me,” replied Sviatopolk, “that Vassilko slew Yaropolk, my brother, that
he was preparing to kill me, that Monomach would take Kief and Vassilko Volynia. I
had to care for my own life. Besides, it was David, not I, who blinded Vassilko. David
took him and on the way home put his eyes out.”
</p>
<p>“Thou canst not lay thy own sins on David. Not in his land, but in thine, was the
deed done,” retorted the envoys, and they left him.
</p>
<p>Next day, when the three princes were marching on Sviatopolk, he prepared to flee
from his capital, but Kief men interposed and sent his stepmother to Monomach. With
her went Nikolai the metropolitan, to beg in the name of the city not to make war
upon Sviatopolk. They presented such reasons that Monomach was moved, and he sent
this injunction: “Since David alone did this deed, as thou sayest, do thou, Sviatopolk,
move against David, and either seize the man captive, or drive him out of his province.”
Sviatopolk declared himself ready to do this.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>Vassilko was meanwhile imprisoned by David, who took every town that he could during
the winter and set out the next spring before Easter to seize all the lands that remained
to his captive. He was met on the boundary, however, by Volodar, who was ready for
battle, hence David took refuge in Bugsk. Volodar moved on that place without waiting,
and sent this question to David: “Why hast thou done so much evil, and wilt not repent
of it? See what immense harm thou hast wrought already.”
</p>
<p>David laid the guilt upon Sviatopolk. “Was it I who did the deed?” asked he. “Was
it done in my capital? I feared to be treated as was thy brother. I was not free;
I was at their mercy.” “God knows which man of you is guilty,” said Volodar. “Give
me my brother and I will make peace with thee.” David was glad to be free of Vassilko,
so peace was declared, and they parted. That peace, however, was not lasting, for
David would not yield the towns which he had taken after blinding Vassilko, hence
the two brothers attacked him at Vsevolod. But David escaped, shut himself in at Vladimir,
and waited.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod was stormed and burned down. As the people fled from the blazing city, Vassilko
commanded Volodar to kill them. Thus he avenged his own wrongs upon innocent people.
</p>
<p>Next the two brothers hastened to Vladimir. “We have come,” declared they to the citizens,
“not against you, but to find Turijak, Vassili, and Lazar, those men who lied foully
to David. Through listening to them he has done dreadful evil; yield those three up
to us. If ye protect them, we must attack you.” The citizens counseled together and
declared then to David: “Yield these three men; for thee we are ready to battle, but
not for them.” “They are not here,” replied David. He had sent those attendants to
Lutsk to save them. The people forced him to bring back Vassili and Lazar; Turijak
had fled to Kief and thus saved himself. Peace was made, and next morning Vassili
and Lazar were hanged on two gibbets, in front of Vladimir.
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk had promised to march against David and expel him, but all this time he
was idle; he set out only after a year, and then he moved not directly, but to Brest
on the boundary, where he made a Polish alliance. He feared to attack single-handed
and acted only when David was beaten by Volodar and Vassilko; even then he wished
the Poles to assist him. He also made <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>an alliance with Volodar and Vassilko, and kissed the cross to them.
</p>
<p>David, too, went to Brest to get Polish aid, and gave fifty gold grievens<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e793src" href="#xd32e793">2</a> to King Vladislav Herman as a present. “Help me!” implored David. “Sviatopolk is
in Brest,” said the king, “I will reconcile thee with him.” Vladislav, however, soon
discovered by experience that the friendship of Sviatopolk brought a greater return
to him than did friendship with David. The Kief prince made richer gifts, and to Vladislav’s
son he gave his daughter in marriage. In view of these facts, the king informed David
that he had failed in discussions with Sviatopolk. “Go home,” said he; “I will send
aid if thy cousin attacks thee.”
</p>
<p>David went home and waited a long time. Sviatopolk laid siege to Vladimir. David held
out, hoping for Polish assistance, which came not. At last he yielded, and the two
princes made peace. David marched out, and Sviatopolk, when he had entered Vladimir
in triumph, began to think of Volodar and Vassilko. “They are on lands which belonged
to my father,” said he, and he marched against the two brothers, forgetting that he
had kissed the cross to them recently. He found it most difficult, however, to deal
with those princes. When he advanced to invade their lands, Volodar and Vassilko met
him promptly on the boundary. Before the battle, which followed immediately, Vassilko
held up the cross which Sviatopolk had kissed, and cried out to him: “See what thou
didst kiss to prove thy good faith to me. Thou hast robbed me of eyesight, and now
thou art trying to kill me. Let this holy cross be between us.”
</p>
<p>The ensuing battle was savage. Sviatopolk was forced from the field and withdrew to
Vladimir, where he put his son, Mystislav, in charge, and sent another son, Yaroslav,
to Hungary to find aid against Volodar and Vassilko, he himself going to Kief in the
meantime.
</p>
<p>At Yaroslav’s call, the Hungarian king, Koloman, came with an army and two bishops
and laid siege at once to Peremysl, where Volodar had fixed himself. David came back
from Poland, where he had begged aid without finding it. Their common danger at this
time brought him and his victim together, and, leaving his wife in Volodar’s care,
he set out to find Polovtsi allies. He met Bonyak, the famous Polovtsi Khan, who returned
with him, bringing <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>a strong force of warriors. They attacked and drove out the Hungarians, and punished
them severely. Yaroslav, son of Sviatopolk, who had brought the Hungarians to Russia,
fled now to the Poles, and David, making use of his victory with promptness, marched
on Vladimir when he was not expected, seized the suburbs and laid siege to the fortress
without delay.
</p>
<p>Mystislav, placed in command, as we have seen, by Sviatopolk, his father, defended
the city successfully till misfortune befell him. He was standing one day on the wall
behind a wooden curtain when an arrow flew in through a crevice and killed him. His
death was concealed from the people for three days. When they learned of it, they
said straightway: “If we surrender now, Sviatopolk will destroy us.” So the chief
men sent to Kief, saying: “Thy son is slain, we are dying of hunger. If thou come
not, the people will yield to the enemy.”
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk sent his voevoda, Putyata, with forces which halted at Lutsk, where Sviatoslav,
son of David of Chernigoff, had warriors. At this juncture envoys from David, son
of Rurik, who was besieging Vladimir, had audience with Sviatoslav, who had just sworn
friendship to them. But when Putyata appeared, this same Sviatoslav was frightened.
He seized David’s envoys, and went himself with his warriors to help Putyata, instead
of helping David. These two allies arrived before Vladimir one midday, and attacked
David. The Vladimir men, seeing this from the walls of the city, made a sally and
David was badly defeated. He fled and Putyata and his ally marched into Vladimir,
where they established one Vassili as lieutenant of Sviatopolk. After that the allies
departed for Lutsk, and Putyata went to Kief.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile David fled quickly toward the steppe land to find Polovtsi. Again he met
Bonyak, who returned with him, and they captured Lutsk and Vladimir, which David now
occupied. Then he sent his nephew, Mystislav, to the mouth of the Dnieper to seize
merchants, and thus force the Grand Prince to sue for peace as he had done formerly—Sviatopolk,
by nature weak and vacillating, had shown that he was not the man to punish David,
who was stronger now than he had ever been before.
</p>
<p>In 1100 a new meeting of princes was arranged to assemble at Vititchevo. At this meeting
the following decision was made known to David: “We will not let thee have Vladimir,
because <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>thou hast cast a knife wickedly between us. We do not exclude thee, or punish thee
further. Thou canst take Bugsk with Ostrog. Sviatopolk gives thee Dubno and Chartorisk,
also Dorogobuj. In addition, Monomach gives thee two hundred grievens, Oleg and David
two hundred more.”
</p>
<p>To Volodar the princes sent the following message: “Take thy brother, Vassilko, and
possess Peremysl. If thou wilt not keep thy brother, let him come to us, we will support
him.”
</p>
<p>Volodar and Vassilko would not comply with this, and each remained in the place which
belonged to him. When the princes wished to constrain the two brothers, Monomach would
not consent to it; he insisted on the Lubetch agreement.
</p>
<p>The two meetings, the first at Lubetch, the second at Vititchevo, ended that struggle
which had raged half a century. The strong princes became stronger, the izgoi (orphans)
and their descendants were excluded. Volodar and Vassilko were the only izgoi who
retained a province. The descendants of Vyacheslav, son of Yaroslav, lost their places
in the first generation; those of Igor, his brother, in the second. Later on they
reappear as petty princes of small places without independent significance. With full
and equal rights appear only the descendants of the three elder sons of Yaroslav,
Izyaslav, Sviatoslav and Vsevolod. Of these, the sons of Sviatoslav saved themselves
only after a bitter and bloody struggle, thanks also to the moderation of Monomach,
and his son Mystislav.
</p>
<p>The division of land between the descendants of these three sons of Yaroslav the Lawgiver
was unequal. Monomach, through his superior personality and favoring fortune, received
a much larger portion than his brothers. He received Pereyaslavl, Novgorod, Smolensk
and Rostoff. Sviatopolk received Volynia, but Novgorod, connected always so closely
with Kief, did not fall to him. The sons of Sviatoslav, Oleg and his brothers, received
nothing beyond the land which their father had held.
</p>
<p>Sviatopolk was greatly dissatisfied that Novgorod did not remain with his house. As
he could not take it from Monomach without compensation, he gave Volynia in return
for it. But when Mystislav, Monomach’s son, was recalled to give place to a son of
Sviatopolk, the men of Novgorod revolted, and sent envoys to Kief with this message:
“Novgorod wishes neither Sviatopolk <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>nor his descendants. If Sviatopolk’s son has two heads, let him come to us.” Sviatopolk
had to live without Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Monomach, now free to act against steppe tribes, urged Sviatopolk to help him. “Let
us join our forces,” said he, “and march in the spring against these enemies.” Sviatopolk
turned to his warriors for counsel. They were unwilling to move, and answered that
war during spring months took men from their labor. “Let us meet in some place, and
consult with the warriors,” was Sviatopolk’s answer to Monomach. They met at Dolobsk,
above Kief, on the bank of the Dnieper. “Begin, brother, thou art the elder,” said
Monomach; “tell what we are to do in our Russia.” “Begin thou, that is better,” answered
Sviatopolk. “How am I to speak,” replied Monomach, “thy warriors will oppose, and
say that I wish to ruin earth-tillers and their labor, though I wonder why they are
so tender of earth-tillers, forgetting how Polovtsi come in the spring-time, strike
down each man in his furrow, take his wife, take his children, seize his horse, and
burn his granary.” “True,” said the warriors. “Thou art right, they do much evil.”
“I am ready to go!” exclaimed Sviatopolk. And he rose and proclaimed the expedition.
“Thou hast done a great deed, O my brother,” said Monomach.
</p>
<p>The two princes sent at once to the sons of Sviatoslav, saying: “Let us march against
the Polovtsi, we shall either fall in the struggle, or survive it.” David promised
aid, but Oleg would not go. His health was too frail, he said. Four other princes
joined willingly in making war on the steppe foes of Russia.
</p>
<p>The Polovtsi learned what was coming, and met in council. Some were in favor of buying
peace, but the younger men called loudly for war, and their side won the mastery.
</p>
<p>A force was sent out to reconnoitre. The princes met this force, cut down every man
in it, advanced on the main army quickly and struck it. A fierce struggle followed.
Twenty Polovtsi chiefs were killed, and a Khan named Beldug was captured. Beldug,
when brought to Sviatopolk, offered much ransom for his life in gold, silver, cattle,
horses and camels. Sviatopolk sent him to Monomach for judgment. “How often hast thou
sworn not to war with us,” said Monomach to the Khan, “but still thou attack. Why
not teach thy sons what an oath is? How much Christian blood hast thou shed? But now
thy own blood be on <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>thee, not on our heads.” With that, he gave a sign to his men, and Beldug was cut
to pieces.
</p>
<p>Immense booty was taken, and the princes went home rejoicing, and with great glory.
The terrible Bonyak was alive yet, however, and made his power felt very keenly.
</p>
<p>In 1106 Sviatopolk sent three voevodas against Polovtsi, whom they defeated, and from
whom they recovered much booty. In 1107, near Pereyaslavl, Bonyak seized large herds
of horses. Somewhat later he appeared with other Khans and encamped at the Sula River
near Lubni. Sviatopolk, Monomach, and Oleg, with four other princes, discovered his
camping-ground, and, stealing up to it, made an attack with great outcry. The Polovtsi
had no time to defend themselves. Those who could seized their beasts, mounted and
fled; those who could not mount rushed off on foot, if they were able. The princes
pursued them to the river Horol, slaying all whom they could reach with their sabres.
</p>
<p>Despite these successes, Oleg and David in that same year held a meeting with two
Khans, whose daughters they took as wives for two of their sons.
</p>
<p>In 1110 an expedition undertaken by Sviatopolk, Monomach and David came to naught,
but in 1111 they set out on the second Monday in Lent, and on Friday before Passion
Week they met the Polovtsi in large force beyond the Don River, and crushed them.
It was not till the following Monday, however, that they found the main host of the
enemy. When the two armies met, there was a roar like thunder, as the chronicler describes
it, and the battle was merciless. Both sides were equal and balanced each other till
David and Monomach, with two regiments, rushed furiously at the enemy’s center and
pierced it. At this the Russians dashed forward with renewed strength, broke the Polovtsi
and, cutting and slashing, pursued them to the steppes.
</p>
<p>This was the greatest victory won up to that time over Polovtsi. The profit of the
exploit was enormous, and the fame of it extended through Europe. It went both to
Rome and to Tsargrad. Though all the princes helped Monomach, they could not of themselves
have conceived such a feat or have accomplished it, hence to him the chief glory was
due, and was given. For him and for the whole land and people there was great benefit
in conquering the Polovtsi. For him, because those tribes were ever ready to <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>harass and plunder, and doubly ready to help any prince in his projects.
</p>
<p>To landless princes, or those who had quarrels, the Polovtsi were ready aids, but
they were the terror of all who tilled land or lived by labor. To a great chief like
Monomach they were enemies nearly always, for principally through them civil war and
disorder were possible. A prince without land or position might find among Polovtsi
at all times men ready to go with him and take their reward in plundering the country
and enslaving as many people as they could lay hands on.
</p>
<p>It was difficult in those days to be a Grand Prince ruling wisely and with justice.
Such a man had to get the throne of Kief first, and then hold it; he had to satisfy,
or eliminate, the unreasoning and unruly; he had to crush or terrorize the Polovtsi;
he had, by victory, a show of power, or a daring front, to ward off his western neighbors.
When these deeds were all accomplished he might begin to work for wealth and order.
We can understand easily the desire of Monomach to crush the Polovtsi, and his joy
at having tamed them, at least for a season.
</p>
<p>In 1113 Sviatopolk died, and Monomach succeeded him, but he took the highest office
only after a hesitation which we may believe to have been shown to make men express
themselves with the utmost emphasis. Sviatoslav was older than Monomach’s father,
but Sviatoslav, though he had been prince in Kief, was prince by expelling Izyaslav
unjustly, and, though Sviatoslav had ceased to live before Izyaslav was reinstated,
and therefore died in office, he might be considered as not having been in Kief at
any time; his sons in this event could have no real claim. In every case the people
would receive no man except Monomach, and he became Grand Prince by acclamation.
</p>
<p>Though the sons of Sviatoslav made no demands in public, they cherished plans in secret,
as was shown somewhat later, and very clearly. But trouble came immediately from other
princes. Glaib of Minsk, a son of Vseslav, that swift moving wizard, so well known
to us, ravaged lands in Monomach’s possessions, and when asked to cease made sharp
reproaches. Because of this, the Grand Prince, in 1116, marched against Minsk with
his sons, and others. The young princes seized various towns, and Monomach resolved
to capture Minsk at every hazard, hence <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>he fixed his camp before it, and had a house built in haste, for headquarters. When
Glaib saw this house, he begged for peace straightway, and it was granted him. Somewhat
later he rebelled again, and in 1120 was brought to Kief, where he died that same
season.
</p>
<p>The next scene of trouble was Volynia. Sviatopolk, the last Grand Prince, had cherished
good feeling toward Monomach, and had caused Yaroslav, his son, to marry the daughter
of Mystislav of Novgorod, son of Monomach. Sometime later, however, Monomach laid
siege to Vladimir, Yaroslav’s capital. After fighting two months, that prince asked
for peace, and Monomach granted it on condition that Yaroslav would come to him whenever
summoned. The attack on Yaroslav had been made because, in connection with Boleslav
of Poland, who had married his sister, he was acting in Galitch against Volodar and
Vassilko. Monomach had remonstrated without effect, and then moved on Yaroslav, with
the result we have just seen. Before going on this expedition, the Grand Prince had
recalled Mystislav from Novgorod, and installed him in Bailgorod, so that in case
of need he might have that son near him. Yaroslav, who, because his father had been
Grand Prince, wished to succeed Monomach, saw in this transfer a step toward taking
the succession from him and giving it to Mystislav, hence his enforced obedience was
short-lived, and he ended it by driving away his wife, a granddaughter of Monomach.
In punishment for this act Monomach moved a second time against him.
</p>
<p>To think of war with Vladimir Monomach, Yaroslav must have counted on large forces,
and have had firm faith in receiving assistance from allies. But just then his own
boyars deserted him, and he was obliged to flee to Hungary, and later on to Poland.
</p>
<p>Monomach then seated in Volynia Roman, his own son, and when this son died, Andrei,
his brother. In 1120 Andrei moved against the Poles with Polovtsi forces. In the following
year Yaroslav set out to attack Cherven in Galitch with Polish forces, but Monomach
had the border towns well strengthened and in Cherven was Ratiborovitch, his voevoda,
who drove back Yaroslav, entirely baffled.
</p>
<p>Most dangerous to the Poles was Volodar, who had as allies tribes in Pomoria and in
Prussia on the Baltic. These tribes were <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>hostile to the Poles. The question now was to stop Volodar. At the court of Boleslav
there lived Peter Vlast, a Dane of many adventures, who advised the king not to meet
Prince Volodar in battle, but to kidnap him, and promised, if permission were given,
to accomplish the deed himself.
</p>
<p>The king was pleased, and Vlast, who had gained much renown through marvelous exploits,
set out with thirty men to win the confidence of Volodar and capture him. He appeared
before the prince and, feigning himself an exile in deadly enmity with Boleslav, quickly
won Volodar’s good-will and confidence. Some weeks later the prince took Vlast to
a hunt in a great forest where, adroitly separated from his own people, Volodar was
seized by Vlast’s men, who bore him beyond the boundary and never drew rein till they
delivered him safely to Boleslav. The king was triumphant.
</p>
<p>Vassilko the Blind gave all the money that he and his brother possessed to free Volodar;
besides this, those two sons of Rostislav swore to act with the Poles against every
enemy.
</p>
<p>In 1123 Yaroslav, son of Sviatopolk, appeared at Vladimir with immense forces,—Cheks,
Poles and Hungarians, bringing also as allies Volodar and Vassilko. Monomach’s son,
Andrei, who was prince there, defended the city. Monomach sent forward Mystislav,
and also hurried men from Kief, but before Mystislav could arrive the siege was well
ended.
</p>
<p>Early one Sunday morning Yaroslav rode toward the walls with two attendants, and shouted
to Andrei and the citizens: “This city is mine! Open ye the gates and come out to
me with homage. If not I will storm the place to-morrow and take it.”
</p>
<p>While he was thus riding in front of the city and boasting, two Poles, employed, as
is said, by Andrei, slipped out and hid near the wayside. When the prince was retiring
from the walls, they sprang up and sent a spear through his body. He reached camp,
barely living, and died a few hours later.
</p>
<p>Stephen&nbsp;II, King of Hungary, thought to continue the siege, but the chiefs of his
army were opposed to shedding blood without profit. In view of this, the allies of
Yaroslav, the late prince, made peace with the Kief prince and retired each to his
own land. Through Yaroslav’s death Sviatopolk’s descendants lost the Kief succession.
Four years later his younger sons, Izyaslav <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>and Bryache, died, so that Volynia and Turoff went to Monomach’s descendants.
</p>
<p>Monomach’s strength with the people swept all men and obstacles before it. Yaroslav,
with a foreign army, failed in Volynia, because the people and the boyars would not
uphold him, but stood firm for Monomach. Monomach saw the danger of Russia’s falling
into a chaos of insignificant and independent principalities, therefore he strove
to increase the authority of the Grand Prince, and to restrict the succession to his
own descendants, with the provision that if the younger brothers died before the eldest,
who was Prince of Kief, their sons were to be excluded forever from the succession.
</p>
<p>New persons now and dramatic scenes pass before us swiftly. Vladimir Monomach, always
spoken of in Russia as Monomach, died in 1125, and with him departed the prosperity
of ancient Russia. He had come to the throne with thirty years of experience in statescraft.
He had been the right hand of his father, and without him Sviatopolk could not have
ruled at all. He was a man who worked always for what he thought to be the good of
his country. Like his grandfather, he was a founder of cities and a lawgiver. There
is an interesting paper still extant which he compiled for the guidance of his sons,
some clauses of which I will quote: “It is neither fasting nor solitude nor monastic
life that will procure you life eternal—it is well doing. Forget not the poor, but
nourish them. Bury not your riches in the earth, for that is contrary to the teachings
of Christianity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e861src" href="#xd32e861">3</a> Be a father to orphans; judge the cause of widows yourself. Put to death no human
being, be he innocent or guilty, for there is nothing more sacred than the soul of
a Christian. Love your wives, but beware lest they obtain power over you. When you
have learned something useful, strive to retain it in your memory, and work unceasingly
for knowledge.”
</p>
<p>Monomach had eight sons, named here in the order of their ages: Mystislav the Great,
who succeeded his father; Izyaslav, killed before Murom in battling against Oleg of
Chernigoff; Sviatoslav, given once as a hostage to Kitan and then stolen away in the
night at Pereyaslavl on the Alta; Roman, famous in nothing, married the sister of
the renowned Vladimirko of Galitch; Yaropolk, <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>who reigned in Kief after Mystislav, and died without issue; Vyacheslav, “of scant
mind and simple,” who raised Monomach’s ensign over the Polovtsi contingent at Koloksha,
and thus routed Oleg; Yuri, named later on Dolgoruki, or Long-Handed (Grasping); and
Andrei, who died rather early.
</p>
<p>The two sons of Vladimir Monomach renowned in history are Mystislav the Great, and
Yuri, surnamed Dolgoruki. From the first comes the elder, from the second the younger
line of Monomach’s descendants. Mystislav became the ancestor of the Western Russian
princes, those of Galitch (Galicia), Smolensk and Volynia. Yuri, through the founding
of Moscow and the results flowing from it, became the father of that northern line
of princes so famous in history. The descendants of these two brothers were often
at enmity, and it was their rivalry which later on ruined Kief.
</p>
<p>Mystislav succeeded his father in 1125 without opposition. Oleg of Chernigoff had
died during Monomach’s reign, so had David, his brother. Only Yaroslav, the youngest
brother, now remained. He, not greatly considered in his family, was expelled from
Chernigoff by Vsevolod, his nephew, and founded in Ryazan a new principality.
</p>
<p>Mystislav’s reign was distinguished for three things. First he brought to order those
Polovtsi who would live in peace near the boundary, and crushed or expelled the others;
then he seized all lands of the Polotsk princes, the descendants of Rognyeda, that
unwilling wife of Vladimir (Saint Vladimir of the Orthodox Church). We have seen how
those Polotsk princes, when excluded from the Kief succession, harried Smolensk and
raided Novgorod, bringing ceaseless trouble and never-ending bloodshed. Later on both
Pinsk and Turoff had been taken from them. This intensified resistance, and, as they
would abate no claim whatever, Mystislav resolved at last to end the trouble. He captured
all those princes and, putting them on a vessel, sent them to Tsargrad, where the
Emperor, his friend, detained the captives. Some died; the survivors, or most of them,
escaped in later days, and ruled again in parts of Polotsk, but soon were lost to
fame, unless the tradition be true that Gedimin and his sons, who seized Western Russia
during Mongol dominion and joined it with Poland through marriage, were descended
from those Polotsk princes who returned <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>from Tsargrad. A third event in Mystislav’s reign was the founding of Ryazan, which
happened in this way.
</p>
<p>Oleg of Chernigoff, who died during Monomach’s reign, was succeeded by his youngest
brother, Yaroslav. Of Oleg’s sons the second, Vsevolod, later on the Kief prince,
was a man who in early life had planned a great career very carefully. He had married
the eldest daughter of Mystislav the Great, and had thus become connected with Monomach’s
descendants. When Mystislav succeeded Monomach, his father, in Kief, Vsevolod drove
his uncle from the throne of Chernigoff, and seated himself there. Vsevolod was unceremonious
with Yaroslav because the man was not strong, and because he himself wanted Kief when
the time came to get it. To possess Kief, he must first win, or get Chernigoff, hence
must drive out his uncle.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav turned for assistance to Mystislav, who was willing to reinstate him by force
even, if need be. It was the proper policy of Kief to act thus, and be the arbiter
in Russia. But times had changed much, and Kief men were no longer willing to fight
for helpless princes. Yaroslav, unable to fight his battles alone, and forced to withdraw
from Chernigoff, settled in Ryazan, where he founded a new line of princes.
</p>
<p>Mystislav reigned seven years and died in 1132. He was succeeded by Yaropolk, his
brother, who, himself without issue, swore to provide in all fairness for Mystislav’s
children. He strove to do this without offending any one, but was unable, as there
were not places enough for the two lines of landless princes. The first step he took
was to summon from Novgorod Vsevolod, son of the late Mystislav, and give him Pereyaslavl
on the Alta. Thereupon Yuri Dolgoruki marched with astonishing swiftness from Suzdal
to the Alta, fell upon Vsevolod and expelled him. His reason for this act was that
for three reigns Pereyaslavl had been, as it were, the stepping-stone to Kief, the
capital and first place, the transfer being made from Pereyaslavl. Dolgoruki, as uncle
to Vsevolod, was his senior, and would not permit him to settle in Pereyaslavl and
thus obtain the succession.
</p>
<p>The sons of Mystislav rose up now against their uncles, and, to gain force sufficient
to war with them, made a league with their cousins, David of Chernigoff and Oleg,
his brother. Yaropolk, Mystislav’s brother, and brother of Yuri, moved against Chernigoff.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>Mystislav’s sons helped the Chernigoff princes, and when these sons attacked their
uncle, Dolgoruki, Vsevolod, son of the late Oleg the endless quarreler, went to help
them. Meanwhile the condition of Kief was almost repeated in Novgorod.
</p>
<p>When the late Prince of Kief, Mystislav the Great, was recalled from Novgorod by Monomach,
his father, his brother Vsevolod was sent to replace him. During Vsevolod’s day the
dignity of prince was lowered notably in Novgorod. In earlier times the posadnik had
been an aid to the prince,—an assistant; he was now his associate, and at times even
his superior. Vsevolod was disliked in Novgorod because, as the men there declared,
he had left it for another place, that is, Pereyaslavl on the Alta. He had fought
against his uncle Dolgoruki, and had fled from him. They said, too, that he cared
only for falcons and hunting; that he sided with the rich, and with boyars; that he
looked with contempt on poor people, and on small folk. To these words they added
a deed never witnessed till that day in Novgorod. They seized Vsevolod, locked him
up in a tower and set a watch around it. They sought then for a prince who might please
them. Some, unwilling to offend Dolgoruki, their dangerous neighbor, thought to choose
Rostislav, his son, as their ruler, but others, who were greater in number, prevailed
and turned to Chernigoff. Vsevolod, son of Oleg, sent his brother, Sviatoslav, but
Novgorod was no better pleased with the new than with the late prince.
</p>
<p>Pskoff, up to this time dependent on Novgorod, resolved now to break its bonds. Vsevolod,
freed from the Novgorod tower and expelled from the city, went to Pskoff and was received
joyfully. Novgorod sent Sviatoslav, its new prince, with warriors to subdue the Pskoff
men, but Sviatoslav, finding the task both impossible and useless, led his men back
to Novgorod. The city, enraged at this failure, turned out the new prince, and sent
him home to Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>Thus disorder was rife in all places, and only after much time and great effort was
Yaropolk, the Grand Prince, able to satisfy his nephews, without, at the same time,
enraging his brothers. When all were in a deadlock of dissension and wearied of fighting,
he gave them lands in the following order: Izyaslav, eldest son of Mystislav, received
for his sons the Polotsk principality, or the greater part of it, and for himself
Volynia and its adjuncts. His <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>brother, Rostislav, received Smolensk, which, increased by additions from Polotsk
and Volynia, became a great principality. Vsevolod, son of Mystislav, connected with
Pskoff till his death, left no posterity. Vladimir and Sviatopolk, also sons of Mystislav,
received nothing and led a landless existence. Yaropolk’s brothers, that is, the other
surviving sons of Monomach, were settled thuswise: Yuri Dolgoruki retained his northern
land in entirety. He obtained also Gorodok on the Oseter, a place which he prized
because of its connection with Kief and with Southern Russia. Pereyaslavl was given
to Andrei, the youngest brother. Having settled questions as best he was able Yaropolk
had little left for himself save the capital.
</p>
<p>It is to be remembered that besides the few leading princes, who gave away or received
immense regions, there was now a horde of small princes, all related to one another
and to the great ones. These it was necessary to satisfy, some with a single town,
others with more, as the case might be. There was not land enough to satisfy all,
however, for sons of the ruling princes were increasing in number. There were also
princes who, dying before they had received places, left orphans. These orphans needed
sustenance; they were of princely blood and, what was of more importance, made trouble
when discontented, if they had power to do so. This great band of land-seekers turned
to the Kief prince, who was for them in the place of a father. Yaropolk, while trying
to settle princes of this kind, was forced to set aside towns to support them till
he could find permanent places. Thus Kief was soon reduced to narrow limits.
</p>
<p>At first the lands of the mother city covered all Southern Russia. On the southwest
and the south they touched the Carpathians and the Danube; on the west they reached
the headwaters of every river flowing toward the Euxine and included some rivers flowing
into the Baltic. They extended toward the Volga and the Caspian till they reached
the territory occupied by the wild tribes of the Polovtsi. But now, by gifts to the
dissatisfied and the demanding, Yaropolk left little to the city. In later reigns
there was nothing left, and in that final day a Kief prince was no longer the highest
power in Russia; he was scarcely more than a guardian of the capital.
</p>
<p>It was not the might of Kief which, in his day, gave Yaropolk <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>influence, but his native worth, and his character, which recalled that of Monomach,
his father. Lofty qualities gave him strength against Vsevolod, the keen, cunning,
shifty son of Oleg. Vsevolod had not seized Chernigoff from his uncle to sit there
in quietness; he aimed at Kief, through which alone power was at that time obtainable,
and power was the lodestar of his existence.
</p>
<p>During Mystislav’s reign Vsevolod had made no move whatever, and, while Yaropolk was
settling with his brothers and nephews, he took no part with the dissatisfied, but
when Yaropolk had decided every question, the crafty Vsevolod joined hands with Igor
and Sviatoslav, his cousins, sons of David, and attacked Yaropolk on both sides of
the Dnieper. Fire and sword swept through those lands on the Ros and the Sula, and
west of the Dnieper a great war began in which all men of weapons took part with eagerness.
After several preliminary battles troops hurried in from many places,—brothers and
nephews came to help Yaropolk. From Volynia, Polotsk, Smolensk, Rostoff, Turoff and
Suzdal did they come. Yaropolk himself led the regiments of Kief and the Black Caps,
called also “Cherkassi” (Circassians).
</p>
<p>At sight of these overwhelming forces Vsevolod lost all hope of victory. He prepared
to abandon Chernigoff and flee to the Polovtsi, but he was stopped by the bishop at
the head of the people. “Halt,” said the bishop; “leave thy pride, and beg for peace.
Yaropolk is kind and generous; he will grant it.” Vsevolod listened to this advice,
and sent envoys to Yaropolk, who received the men graciously, gave presents in return
for those brought by them, forgave Vsevolod, and made peace.
</p>
<p>Yaropolk’s advisers were enraged at this peace. They desired the destruction of Vsevolod,
and wished to avenge their comrades who had fallen in recent battles, but Yaropolk
was firm; he dismissed his forces and returned to Kief, where he ruled for a season,
and then died, after years of sore trial and effort.
</p>
<p>Yaropolk was succeeded in 1150 by his brother, Vyacheslav, a prince “poor in wit,
and simple,” as the chronicler assures us, but in fact a person original and most
interesting,—one of “God’s fools” in the language of myth tales. Vsevolod’s chance
appeared now, and he seized it greedily. He promised Chernigoff to his cousins, Monomach’s
descendants, and then pledged to his brothers all the possessions of those same descendants
of Monomach, <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>thus promising to men what was not their own, but their neighbors’. He fell upon Kief,
fired the suburbs, and sent this message to Vyacheslav: “Go in peace out of Kief.”
“Not of myself did I come to Kief,” replied Vyacheslav; “I came, commanded by my ancestors
and in succession to my brother. If thou, abandoning thine own, hast come to take
what belongs to thy senior, I will offer no resistance; I become thy junior.” And
he went out of Kief, thus making his withdrawal a reproach and a shame to Vsevolod.
</p>
<p>That prince, however, cared no whit for reproach and shame; he wanted power. To him
all else, be it right or wrong, was as nothing. Hence he entered Kief in pomp and
great circumstance. An immense feast was placed before the people, and to the monasteries
and churches rich presents were given. Highly gifted with the art of pleasing, and
lavish of money and flattery, Vsevolod won the multitude quickly.
</p>
<p>This seizure and holding of sovereignty by a man in a junior and excluded line was
a real exploit. How did Vsevolod accomplish it; and, once having Kief, how did he
hold it? Why did Monomach’s descendants let Oleg’s son take possession of the city,
which was theirs by inheritance, and thus lose that which distinguished them from
all other princes?
</p>
<p>The position of Monomach’s descendants was peculiar at this juncture. It was involved
beyond measure. Though the strongest group of men in Russia, they had no leader. The
oldest of Monomach’s three surviving sons, Vyacheslav the Simple, was incompetent
in action; the second, Yuri Dolgoruki, was competent, but not ready at that time.
He was little known in southern regions, and, so far as known, was unpopular. Andrei,
the youngest brother, was popular, but could not be the leader.
</p>
<p>The man best fitted to be Grand Prince was Izyaslav, then ruling in Volynia. He was
the eldest son of Mystislav the Great, who was the eldest son of Monomach. But Izyaslav
was barred from action by his three living uncles, the younger brothers of his father.
He could not win Kief without them, and they would neither yield to him, nor help
him.
</p>
<p>The house of Monomach was thus divided. Vsevolod saw clearly that, thanks to this
division, he could seize the capital, and hold it. Hence he hastened to win over Izyaslav
with the following <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>message: “At thy father’s death, Kief should have been thine, but thy uncles would
not suffer thee to take it; they expelled thee and thy brothers from every place,
and had I not assisted, ye would to-day have no land in Russia. I want Kief. Thou
and thy brothers will be as my own blood to me. Ye will get the choicest places, and
at my death Kief will fall to thee, Izyaslav, but thou and they must not help thy
uncles to oppose me.”
</p>
<p>These words pleased Izyaslav; he and Vsevolod made a pact and kissed the cross to
keep it. Owing to this pact, Vsevolod appeared in Kief with slender forces and found
few men opposing, though Kief might have resisted very easily. Once in power, Vsevolod
became expectant; he waited to see what would happen.
</p>
<p>The Monomach party, both uncles and nephews, met promptly for counsel. Izyaslav went
to Smolensk to confer with Rostislav, to whom Dolgoruki went also. Rostislav could
not act with both nephews and uncles. To Dolgoruki he had been respectful at all times,
and now Dolgoruki’s talks with him were successful. Vsevolod learned of this, and
was ready for action immediately. He made proposals to Izyaslav, whom he invited to
Kief. Izyaslav would not go; he had lost all faith in Vsevolod; he would have nothing
further to do with him.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav and his friends now began preparations for an attack on the usurper.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod resolved to forestall his enemies; to meet each separately, take his land
and give it to his brothers as he had promised. Against Vyacheslav, whom he had driven
out of Kief, and Izyaslav, his cousin, he sent Izyaslav, son of David, with Vladimirko
and Rostislav, the Galitch princes, grandsons of Rostislav. Vsevolod himself marched
against Andrei, son of Monomach, in Pereyaslavl, taking with him his own brother Sviatoslav,
for whom he intended this city. While on the road he sent Andrei a message containing
the sentence: “Go thou to Kursk!” “I will die rather than leave my inheritance,” retorted
Andrei. “My father ruled here, not in Kursk. If there is not sufficient land for thee
elsewhere in Russia, and thou must have this place, slay me and take it. While I live,
I will not leave what belongs to me.”
</p>
<p>Vsevolod did not in person attack Andrei’s forces, but sent Sviatoslav, his brother,
who was defeated. Next day they made peace. The terms, as we know them, left Andrei
in his capital <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>while he agreed to join in no war upon Vsevolod, and to recognize him as Grand Prince.
The prince returned to Kief then, defeated, but still with some part of a victory.
</p>
<p>The attack on Volynia was a failure, but Vladimirko of Galitch and the Poles, his
allies, succeeded in a degree. They captured towns, but they could not expel Izyaslav
or his uncle. There, as in other places outside of Chernigoff, the people favored
Monomach’s line, though neither Yuri of Suzdal nor Rostislav of Smolensk had given
aid to them. The reason aid did not come was that Novgorod would not help Izyaslav,
and had driven out Yuri’s son Rostislav. Yuri returned then to Suzdal and seized Torjok
to punish Novgorod by stopping supplies.
</p>
<p>While Yuri was acting thus, Rostislav of Smolensk dared not move against Vsevolod.
Peace was concluded because of this balance of forces. Izyaslav got Volynia, and Vsevolod
was acknowledged as Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>Division among opponents gave Vsevolod the headship. Had they been united he could
not have taken Kief, or, if he had taken that city, he could not have retained it.
Even now his hold, though efficient, was exceedingly slender and delicate, for among
his adherents, that is, his cousins and his brothers, there was endless dissension
and wrangling.

<h2 class="main">STRUGGLES FOR THE THRONE OF KIEF</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The death of Andrei, son of Monomach, brought many changes. Vsevolod induced Vyacheslav,
Yuri’s brother, to take Pereyaslavl, that city which led to the Kief succession, and
leave Turoff, where he put Sviatoslav, his own son. “He has a principality for his
son, but for us he has nothing,” cried Vsevolod’s brothers. “It was heavy at their
hearts,” adds the chronicler.
</p>
<p>Hereupon Vsevolod summoned his cousins and brothers to a council, saying he wished
to make peace with them if possible. Having no confidence in Vsevolod, they would
not enter the city, so the two parties encamped on the Dnieper, near Kief, and held
communication from side to side of the river. Since the terms proposed by the Grand
Prince, one town to each of his relatives, were acceptable to none of them, his brothers
kissed the cross to each other and to their cousins, then joined in a pact to resist
the injustice of Vsevolod. Still he did not increase his first offer. Thereupon they
marched against Vyacheslav, thinking to have as easy a victory over him as had Vsevolod,
when he took Kief from this simple-minded and interesting old prince. But Pereyaslavl
met them firmly, and, failing to take the city by assault, they laid siege to it.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod reënforced the place promptly, and Izyaslav of Volynia hurried men to his
uncle. The besiegers were defeated and driven off by Vyacheslav.
</p>
<p>Rostislav of Smolensk moved now from the west against Chernigoff territory. Izyaslav
attacked it on the east, and seizing many places returned home with great honor. A
new attack was made upon Vyacheslav soon after by the malcontents, who fought a three
days’ battle, in which they were sorely defeated.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod now summoned Sviatosha, his cousin, a monk renowned <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>widely for sanctity, to aid him in reasoning with his relatives, and he himself sent
them this message: “Dear brethren, take what I offer with good feeling; fight with
me no longer.” Discouraged by defeat and influenced by the monk they accepted, and
settled in Kief.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod, who owed what he had to his own subtle cunning and to the dissension among
princes, was dissatisfied with the league between his brothers and their cousins.
So, to detach the sons of David from the league, he said to them: “Leave my brothers;
I will give you all splendid places.” Tempted by this promise, they deserted their
allies, and received good places.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod’s brothers were incensed at this open treachery, but were silent for the
time. They clamored later on, however, and very loudly, when Vyacheslav, advised by
Vsevolod, exchanged principalities with Izyaslav, his nephew of Volynia, and then
gave Volynia for Turoff, from which Vsevolod recalled his own son, whom he sent to
Volynia straightway.
</p>
<p>Pereyaslavl, as the stepping-stone to Kief, was acceptable to Izyaslav, who wanted
the succession most solemnly promised him. But Vsevolod’s brothers and his cousins
were greatly angered by this change, which they understood not, and which they looked
on as an act of monstrous treason. “Our brother keeps at his side the worst foes of
our family,” complained they. “He leaves us without a chief, and without places,”
and they urged Vsevolod to act against Monomach’s descendants, and demand the places
which he had pledged to them earlier, but had not given.
</p>
<p>It would have been difficult, nay, quite impossible for Vsevolod to keep those promises,
and he made no real effort to do so. Izyaslav was disquieted, however. He saw clearly
what Vsevolod was doing. He knew him to be an inveterate trickster, who would deceive
all men, who ever they might be, whenever the chance came and his interest required
it, so he resolved to change the position if possible, and try to win Yuri, his uncle.
He journeyed to Suzdal to see him, but he could make no impression on Yuri. Next he
went to Rostislav, his brother, in Smolensk, and, last of all, to his brother in Novgorod,
where he passed the winter. Thus did the descendants of Monomach and Oleg stand toward
one another. How stood the other princes?
</p>
<p>First among these were the descendants of Rostislav, whose <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>sons, Volodar and Vassilko, are well-known to us. Both died in 1124, the first leaving
two sons, Vladimirko and Rostislav; the second left two also, Grigori and Ivan.
</p>
<p>Of these four men, Vladimirko alone was remarkable. This prince not only kept his
own among others, but was able to leave a strong principality to his son, whose friendship
or enmity became highly important. Being weaker at first than most of his neighbors
Vladimirko worked for success without reference to truthfulness or methods. In 1127
he called in the Hungarians and rose against Rostislav, his elder brother. His cousins
came to the aid of Rostislav, as did also Mystislav, the Kief prince, and saved him.
Rostislav died some years later; his two cousins died also. Thereupon Vladimirko took
all Galitch, disregarding his nephew, Ivan, then ruling in Zvenigorod. The wars which
followed the death of Mystislav the Great left a free hand to Vladimirko.
</p>
<p>In Vsevolod’s struggle with Monomach’s descendants, Vladimirko helped him, but matters
changed altogether when the son of the Kief prince was transferred to Volynia. Vsevolod
might permit Vladimirko to snatch land from a descendant of Monomach, but not from
Sviatoslav, his son. Both men were perfectly selfish, neither had scruples of any
kind, and in 1144 Vsevolod quarreled with Vladimirko because of Volynia, and marched
against Galitch with a large army. Nine Russian princes went with him, and the Polish
prince Vladislav. Vladimirko had called in his friends, the Hungarians, but his troops,
outnumbered and cut off, would have been forced to surrender had he not saved himself
cunningly through Igor, the Kief prince’s brother, to whom he sent this wily message:
“Reconcile me with thy brother, and I will make thee prince in Kief, after Vsevolod.”
Igor, influenced by this promise, set about making peace, and succeeded.
</p>
<p>Vladimirko went from his camp and bowed down before Vsevolod. He, “the cunning-minded
and word-rich,” as people called him, brought Vsevolod to think it far better for
him not to weaken Galitch too greatly, so Vsevolod, after taking an oath from Vladimirko,
and a large ransom, restored all the towns which he had captured, and returned to
his capital.
</p>
<p>Vladimirko’s enemies now grew more defiant, and the citizens of Galitch installed
in that city his nephew, Ivan, surnamed later Berladnik. Vladimirko hastened with
forces to Galitch, and besieged <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>it for three weeks unsuccessfully, till Ivan made a night attack, went too far out,
and was cut off from his capital. Unable to return, he broke through the investing
lines, made his way to the Danube, and through steppe regions to Kief, where Vsevolod
received him with kindness. Vladimirko entered Galitch, and there met his opponents
without mercy.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod’s reception of Ivan was, beyond doubt, the cause of a second war with Vladimirko.
In 1146 Vsevolod led to Galitch large forces, among which were Poles, men of Novgorod,
and Polovtsi. Siege was laid to Zvenigorod. When some of the citizens wished to surrender
Vladimirko’s commander slew three of their leaders, cut each of the bodies in two,
and hurled the six halves from the walls of the city. After that, those inside fought
with valor. Vsevolod, who tried to storm the place, fought from daylight till evening.
He fired the town in three places, but the people extinguished the fires, and resisted
with desperation. The Kief prince at last raised the siege and returned home, forced
mainly by an illness of which he died somewhat later.
</p>
<p>The position of Novgorod in Vsevolod’s day was most difficult; when this prince drove
Vyacheslav from Kief, Yuri Dolgoruki asked aid of Novgorod against the usurper, but
the city refused to help him. He immediately recalled his son, who was then prince
in Novgorod, and, seizing Torjok, stopped Novgorod’s provisions. The city sent then
to Vsevolod for a prince, and was forced to accept from him Sviatoslav, his brother,
a second time. A riot was kindled by Monomach’s partisans, and it was raging fiercely
when the new prince arrived. Sviatoslav, deposed recently for his failure at Pskoff,
remembered his enemies and punished them. They resented this, and soon the position
presented a deadlock. “It is grievous for me to be here with these people,” wrote
the prince to his brother. “I cannot endure them.”
</p>
<p>To weaken the Monomach party, and smooth Sviatoslav’s way for him, Vsevolod induced
the city to send him seven of its best men. Upon their arrival he threw them all into
prison. This measure roused Novgorod greatly. Sviatoslav’s partisans were beaten at
assemblies, and he himself, learning that he might be seized, fled in the night out
of Novgorod, the posadnik, Yakun, going with him. Yakun was captured on the road and
brought back to the city, with Prokop, his brother. Beaten by the people <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>till almost insensible, these two men were stripped of their clothing, and hurled
from the bridge into the Volkov. Wading out, they were seized again, but not beaten.
Yakun was fined one thousand silver grievens, and Prokop one hundred. Then the hands
of both men were tied to their necks and they were cast into prison. After a time,
however, they escaped to Yuri of Suzdal, who treated them kindly.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Bishop of Novgorod went to Kief with a number of notables, and said
to Vsevolod: “Give us thy son; we want not thy brother.” Vsevolod consented, and sent
his son, Sviatoslav. While the young prince was traveling toward Novgorod, people
sent secondly to Vsevolod: “We want neither thy son, nor any man of thy family. Give
us a son of Mystislav.” Hereupon Vsevolod detained the bishop and notables, and, not
wishing to see a man of Monomach’s line prince in Novgorod, summoned his wife’s brothers,
Sviatopolk and Vladimir, and gave them the Brest principality. “Think not of Novgorod,”
said he, “let it have whatever prince pleases it.” After that, Novgorod was nine months
without a prince, which for that proud city was unendurable. Grain was stopped by
Yuri of Suzdal, and the price of food was enormous. The party hostile to Kief, which
found favor with Yuri, rose in strength and increased greatly. They invited Yuri to
Novgorod. He was not willing to go himself, but he sent his son, Rotislav.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod saw now that he had erred in not sending a brother-in-law, hence he vented
his rage against Yuri. He took possession of Gorodok, Yuri’s capital, and seized his
herds in southern regions. That did not settle the Novgorod question, however. Izyaslav,
brother of Vsevolod’s wife, and prince now in Pereyaslavl, sent to his sister a message,
which contained these words: “Get Novgorod for Sviatopolk, thy brother.” She set to
work, and finally Vsevolod consented. He saw, of course, without any advice, that
for him his wife’s brother in Novgorod was better than a son of Prince Yuri. Besides,
the expulsion of Yuri’s son in favor of one of his nephews would widen the breach
between Yuri and all his near relatives, a thing most desirable for Vsevolod.
</p>
<p>When men heard in Novgorod that Sviatopolk was coming, and with him the bishop and
notables, the opponents of Yuri rose in power again, for the city must choose to retain
Yuri’s son, <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>and be hostile to Vsevolod and all his adherents, or receive Sviatopolk and have Yuri
alone as an enemy. Sviatopolk was installed, and Rostislav sent away to his father.
Thus was the question decided.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod, double-dealing and shifty at all times, had promised the succession of Kief
both to Igor, his own brother, and also to his wife’s brother, Izyaslav, who, as if
selected for the place, had Pereyaslavl for his portion. Igor had the promise renewed
in Galitch, when he made peace between the Kief prince and Vladimirko, the latter
guaranteeing his aid to obtain the position.
</p>
<p>In 1145 Vsevolod, in presence of his cousins and brothers—Izyaslav also was in the
assembly—declared Igor to be his successor. “Vladimir Monomach,” said the prince,
“placed Mystislav, his son, on the Kief throne. Mystislav gave Kief to Yaropolk, his
brother. Whenever God calls for me, Kief will go to Igor.”
</p>
<p>Oleg’s descendants knew well that these two Monomach successions broke the old rule
by which Kief should belong to the senior among Yaroslav the Lawgiver’s descendants.
The descendants of Monomach had violated this rule in their own line, by rejecting
it. As they had led the way in destroying precedents, Vsevolod could now declare himself
justified in following their example. Izyaslav opposed this decision, but with no
avail. He was forced to kiss the cross in favor of Igor.
</p>
<p>In 1146, when returning in illness from the second campaign against Galitch, Vsevolod
halted at Vyshgorod, and summoned the principal Kief men. “I am ill; take my brother
as Grand Prince,” said he. “We do so with gladness,” responded the Kief men. Igor
went with these men to the capital, where he assembled the citizens, and they kissed
the cross to him. “Thou art our prince,” declared they, but “they deceived,” says
the chronicler. Next day the Vyshgorod citizens also kissed the cross to Igor.
</p>
<p>Just before dying, Vsevolod sent to Izyaslav and to his brothers to learn if they
adhered to their oaths taken solemnly. “We adhere,” replied all. After Vsevolod’s
death, Igor made the Kief men take oath a second time, and the affair seemed concluded.
But later, the Kief men assembled again, and sent to Izyaslav the words: “Come hither,
O Prince!”
</p>
<p>Igor sent Sviatoslav, his brother, to Kief, and remained himself <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>with the warriors. The Kief men complained of Ratsha and Tudor, two tiuns (high officials).
“Ratsha plundered Kief, and Tudor stripped Vyshgorod,” said they to Sviatoslav. “Now
kiss the cross for thy brother, to give us fair justice.” “I kiss the cross for my
brother, that ye will suffer no violence, and that ye will have tiuns to suit you.”
When he had said this, he dismounted and kissed the cross. Chosen men went with Sviatoslav
to Igor, who kissed the cross to do what his brother had promised. But, since the
old tiuns were left in their places, men rushed to Ratsha’s house and attacked it.
Igor sent troops and his brother to defend the tiuns, which they did with difficulty.
Meanwhile he sent a message to Izyaslav, asking if he held to the oath which he had
taken. Izyaslav gave no answer; he even detained the envoy.
</p>
<p>Since Igor retained the old tiuns, the Kief men decided quickly, and sent to Izyaslav,
saying: “Come to us, Prince, we desire thee!” Izyaslav marched now against Kief. On
the way, all towns declared for him. “Thou art ours, we will have no son of Oleg.
March on!” shouted they. “We are with thee!” On he went, and soon he was met by Kief
envoys. “Thou art our prince,” declared they. “We will not be the inheritance of Oleg’s
son.”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Igor sent for support to his cousins, the sons of David. They wished to
sell that support at the highest price. Igor gave what they demanded and promised
to give all that he could give when he reached power, if they would take the field
for him. Still more important for Igor were his late brother’s warriors. He also strove
to secure the chief boyars by promising to those men their old places, but he was
late with the promise for the boyars, observing that the people had cast him aside,
had deserted already in secret. Quick to abandon a lost cause, they sent this message
to Izyaslav: “Hasten, Prince. The sons of David are coming to aid thy opponent.” Sviatoslav’s
men were no more faithful than were those of his brother Igor. They, too, were prepared
to desert at the critical moment.
</p>
<p>When Izyaslav appeared before Kief with his forces, the people were gathered at one
side in a large body. Some distance away was the army of Igor. Izyaslav sent at once
a chief and a banner to the people. A detachment fell upon Igor’s camp, and then came
a fierce battle. The boyars, devoted to Izyaslav, went over immediately, <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>and Igor’s cause was lost very quickly. His whole army fled.
</p>
<p>While fleeing, Igor’s horse stuck fast in a swampy place, and the prince, unable to
move, had to stay there alone with the animal. Sviatoslav, Igor’s brother, fled to
Chernigoff; Sviatoslav, his nephew, took refuge in Kief, where he was captured.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav entered the capital with honor, and sat on the throne of his father and grandfather.
All boyars faithful to Igor were captured and held until ransomed. The Kief people
plundered the houses of Igor’s adherents and those of the late Vsevolod’s officials,
taking much property of all kinds. Igor himself was found in the swamp four days later,
and brought to Izyaslav, who put him first in a monastery, and then in prison, whence
he was freed some time later.
</p>
<p>Thus power returned to Monomach’s descendants. Passing two uncles, Vyacheslav and
Yuri, it came to a nephew, because Izyaslav, through his personal qualities, satisfied
the people, while the uncles did not please them. When Izyaslav first rose against
Igor, he stated that it was to restore the Kief throne to his uncle, but when he was
marching, the people declared: “Thou art our prince.” Hence when he took Kief, he
kept it because the people wished him to keep it. Of course, he himself was quite
willing. The people did not want Vyacheslav, though his right was undoubted, but the
boyars, knowing they could rule through him, wanted the old man. Acting on their advice,
he seized principalities, among others Volynia, but Izyaslav soon forced him to restore
them, for the new prince held firm possession.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sviatoslav, brother of Igor, fled with small forces to Chernigoff, and inquired
of the sons of David if they intended to keep their oath to his brother. “We do,”
replied they. Leaving with them his boyar, Kosnyatka, Sviatoslav set out for his own
lands to take an oath from the people there. Once he had gone, the sons of David made
their plans apart from Kosnyatka, who, learning by chance that they were plotting
to seize Sviatoslav, sent at once to warn him. The sons of David, since their cousins
could now obtain nothing west of the Dnieper, feared that they would take land from
them in Chernigoff, hence they decided to join the Grand Prince against their cousin,
and sent to Izyaslav, saying:
</p>
<p>“Igor is as hostile to us as to thee; hold him firmly.” To <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>Sviatoslav they sent this message: “Take Putival and abandon thy brother Igor.” “I
am seeking my brother, not land,” replied Sviatoslav. “Take land and kiss the cross,”
said the sons of David. Sviatoslav wept and sent to Yuri of Suzdal, saying: “God took
Vsevolod, and now Izyaslav has taken Igor. Be gracious; march against Kief; free my
brother, while I, with God’s aid, will bring forces hither to help thee.”
</p>
<p>Then he asked for men from the Polovtsi Khans, his wife’s uncles. They sent a detachment
of warriors with promptness. From Murom came Vladimir, a grandson of that Yaroslav
whom Vsevolod had driven from Chernigoff in order to take Kief later on, which he
did successfully.
</p>
<p>This Yaroslav, who founded the Ryazan line of princes, had two sons: Sviatoslav and
Rostislav. When the former died in Murom, Rostislav took his land and sent Glaib his
own son to rule in Ryazan, giving nothing to Vladimir, his nephew, who came now to
join Sviatoslav. After him came the nephew of Vladimirko of Galitch—Ivan, surnamed
Berladnik, from Berlad, a town in Moldavia, which was filled with adventurers of all
kinds. Ivan had found there a refuge, and next a small party of daredevils to join
him. The sons of David wished now to crush Sviatoslav at all cost. “We have begun
a hard task,” said they to one another; “let us end it. Let us kill Sviatoslav and
take his possessions.” They saw that while alive he would fight to free Igor; in that
his success lay. Triumph and love for his brother had for him become one thing. They
remembered that in the late reign Igor and his brother had continually insisted upon
having land in Chernigoff, and had been restrained only by promises of Kief and of
places about it. What now could restrain those men? Of course only lands in Chernigoff.
They could not get lands in another place.
</p>
<p>David’s sons begged aid of the Kief prince, who sent his son, Mystislav, with warriors
to help them. The allies attacked Novgorod Seversk and fought three days there. They
plundered the region about, and seized all the horses belonging to Igor and Sviatoslav.
News came at this juncture that Yuri of Suzdal was Sviatoslav’s ally, and was marching
to aid him.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav, the Grand Prince, now asked Rostislav of Murom to attack Yuri’s country.
The Murom prince moved at once. We have seen that Rostislav’s nephew and enemy, Vladimir,
was in <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>Sviatoslav’s camp, being thus an ally of Yuri, hence Rostislav was ready to fight
against Yuri. Besides, Rostislav could not have been friendly to the sons of Oleg,
one of whom had driven his father from his throne in Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>Yuri had reached Kozelsk, when he heard that Rostislav of Murom was attacking his
country. This forced him back, but he sent his son, Ivan, who received Kursk and lands
on the Seim as reward from Sviatoslav. It was clear that the latter would give what
he had to preserve the alliance, and, with Yuri’s aid, redeem Igor. After he had given
half his land for this ally, he tried, at the advice of his boyars, to win the sons
of David to his cause, and sent to them his priest with this message: “Ye have ravaged
my lands, seized my herds and the herds of my brother. Ye have burned my provisions
and destroyed all my property; nothing remains for you now, but to kill me.” “Abandon
thy brother,” answered the sons of David. “I would rather die,” replied Sviatoslav,
“than abandon my brother. I will strive for him while life is in me.”
</p>
<p>The sons of David now plundered on every side. They took Igor’s town, where he had
a residence. In his cellars were mead and wines, in his storehouses goods of much
value. All that men could remove they took with them, then they fired the place, burning
nine hundred stacks of grain.
</p>
<p>While Izyaslav was hastening from Kief with his warriors, David’s sons moved on Putivl,
but the town was held firmly by the people till the Kief prince appeared before it.
They yielded to him, when he kissed the cross to respect them, and merely installed
his own posadnik, instead of the old one. He and his allies, however, seized all of
Sviatoslav’s wealth in Putivl,—wine, mead, provisions and seven hundred slaves. Sviatoslav
himself, advised by his allies, had fled northward, to be close to provisions and
near Yuri of Suzdal, taking with him his wife and children, and also the wife of Igor.
Some of his warriors had deserted, but the best remained faithful. The sons of David
were infuriated by this flight of their cousin, and at once resolved to capture the
man or kill him. Izyaslav said, “Let us follow Sviatoslav. If by any chance he escapes
us, we will at least seize his wife and children, and take all of his property.” And
with three thousand horsemen he set out to hunt down his cousin. When this force was
<span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>gaining on him, Sviatoslav pondered whether it were better to save his own person
by flight and let his warriors and family be captured, or remain with them and lay
down his life fighting. His men were not many, but they were of excellent quality,—Ivan,
a son of Yuri of Suzdal, Ivan Berladnik, Vladimir of Murom, the Polovtsi party, and
some others. He had to meet thousands with hundreds, but he chose to remain, and,
turning on the son of David in a forest, he routed him thoroughly; then he fled farther
as swiftly as possible.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince and Vladimir, the other son of David, following on at some distance
behind, had stopped to take food, when news came that Sviatoslav had defeated his
pursuers. The Kief prince was enraged at this failure, and set out himself in immediate
pursuit of the fugitive. On the way he was joined by stragglers from the scattered
force, and at last came the son of David.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav hastened forward to Koracheff, and as Izyaslav was again hunting him sharply,
he fled to great forests in Vyatichi regions, where pursuit was impossible.
</p>
<p>“I hold the places which ye desired,” said the Kief prince to the sons of David. “Take
ye the lands of Sviatoslav; I yield them all to you. Igor’s slaves and his goods in
those lands will be mine. Sviatoslav’s goods we will divide between us.” After making
this distribution, he returned to his capital.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Igor, who lay ill in prison, wished to assume a monk’s habit, and requested
permission. “Thou mayst do that,” replied Izyaslav. “I intended to free thee in every
case.” Taken from prison to a cell in a monastery, Igor lay eight days and nights
without food or drink. At last he revived and took the monk’s habit.
</p>
<p>The conflict still raged between Sviatoslav and his cousins. Izyaslav had left in
Chernigoff his sister’s son, Sviatoslav, the son of Vsevolod, the late Grand Prince.
The interests of this Sviatoslav were closely connected with the house of Oleg. A
decisive defeat of his uncle would destroy this “sister’s son’s” chance of being prince
in Chernigoff, to which he aspired, as the first son of Vsevolod. Hence, in secret,
he favored his uncle, and informed him of all that his enemies were doing.
</p>
<p>Yuri of Suzdal now sent fresh warriors to Sviatoslav, who with <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>them was ready to rend his pursuers, when Yuri’s son, Ivan, who led them, died suddenly.
The sons of David feared to attack Yuri’s warriors, but they urged leading men of
the Vyatichi, in whose towns their posadniks were stationed, to kill Sviatoslav and
scatter his forces. At this point two of Yuri’s sons, one of whom was Andrei, later
on very famous, forced Rostislav, the Murom prince, who was attacking their father,
to flee to the Polovtsi.
</p>
<p>That same year, 1146, Yuri invited Sviatoslav, his ally, to meet him in Moscow (Moskva).
This name appears now for the first time in the chronicles of Russia. Originally a
farm on the river Moskva, and owned by one Stephen Kuchka, it was called Kuchkova.
When the land came into the possession of Yuri Dolgoruki, he built a village on an
elevation and called it Moskva. There was feasting and gift-giving now in Moscow,
but also much serious work. Yuri furnished warriors, led by his son, and fresh troops
of Polovtsi came to Sviatoslav; thus he had power to take the offensive. This he did
with effect, and when a third force of Polovtsi came, the effect was decisive. All
the posadniks installed in Vyatichi towns by the sons of David fled quickly, and Sviatoslav
sent in new men to replace them. Both sons of David withdrew from the north to Chernigoff,
and sent peace proposals to Sviatoslav. Those same sons of David now turned traitorously
on the Kief prince, to whom they sent this faithless message: “Sviatoslav has taken
Vyatichi lands. Come with us to attack him. When we have driven him away we will march
with thee against Yuri, and make peace or war with him.”
</p>
<p>Izyaslav agreed, but Sviatoslav, son of Vsevolod, to make sure of carrying out his
own plans and escaping beyond reach of the Kief prince in season, came to Izyaslav,
and said to him, “Let me go to Chernigoff, my father. I wish to get lands from my
cousins.” “Thou hast thought this out well,” replied Izyaslav. “Go straightway.” He
went, and the whole affair was fixed surely, as they thought. He and the sons of David
were to seize the Kief prince the moment he set foot in Chernigoff. As he delayed,
they sent envoys to hurry him. “Our land is perishing,” said they, “and thou wilt
not come to assist us.”
</p>
<p>Izyaslav summoned his boyars and warriors and the people, and said to them: “I am
going with the sons of David to war against Sviatoslav, and Yuri my uncle. I must
go, for Yuri is <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>helping my enemy, Sviatoslav.” “Go not against Yuri,” said the people. “Make peace
with thy uncle. Lend no ear to the sons of David, take not the same road with them.”
“I must go,” replied Izyaslav; “they are my allies.” “Take it not ill of us,” continued
the people, “we cannot raise hands against a son of Monomach. But if thou wilt march
against the house of Oleg, we will not only go with thee, but take our sons also.”
</p>
<p>The prince, however, asked for volunteers to attack Yuri, and a large number went
with him. On passing the Dnieper, he sent Ulaiba, his boyar, to learn what was happening
in Chernigoff. The boyar hurried back, bringing news that the allies of the Kief prince
were acting with Sviatoslav. Chernigoff friends also sent to Izyaslav, saying that
his allies were deceiving him foully. “They wish to slay or to seize thee, and liberate
Igor. They have kissed the cross to Sviatoslav, and also to Yuri.”
</p>
<p>The Kief prince now sent envoys to confer in his name with the sons of David: “We
agreed on a great work, and kissed the cross to each other,” said the envoys. “Let
us kiss it again, so that there be no disagreement hereafter.” “Why kiss again? We
have kissed already,” replied the sons of David. “What harm in kissing the cross?”
said the envoys. “The cross is salvation.” But they refused to kiss it a second time.
The envoys repeated now these words from Izyaslav to the sons of David: “I have heard
that ye are deceiving me, that ye have sworn to Sviatoslav to seize me or to kill
me because of Igor. Is this true, brothers, or is it not true?” They would not answer.
At last one of them said to the envoys: “Withdraw, we will summon thee later.” They
consulted long, and then called the envoys.
</p>
<p>“We have kissed the cross to Sviatoslav,” declared they frankly. “We grieve over Igor,
our cousin. He is a monk now; set him free, and we will ride at thy stirrup. Would
it please thee if we held thy brother?” The treaty papers were cast at their feet,
and these words were added in answer: “Ye took oath to be with me till death, and
I gave you the lands of both sons of Oleg. I expelled Sviatoslav; I won his lands
and gave you Putivl with other places. We divided Sviatoslav’s property between us.
I took Igor’s. And now, brothers, ye have broken your oath. Ye invited me hither intending
to kill me. Let God be on my side and <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>the power of the life-giving cross. I will manage as the Lord may assist me.”
</p>
<p>The prince asked Rostislav, his brother, to bring Smolensk forces from all sides.
He sent to Kief also, explaining the conduct of the sons of David, and reminded the
people of what they had promised. The Kief men decided immediately to go forward in
boats and on horseback to help him. “We rejoice,” declared they in a message, “that
God has preserved thee. We come and bring our sons with us, according to promise!”
When thus excited, some man in the throng called out loudly: “We will fight for our
prince, but think first of one important thing. Here in this city is the enemy of
our prince. Let us slay him to finish that family in Chernigoff, and then go!” The
people rushed to the monastery, and before Prince Vladimir, the metropolitan, or the
commander in the city, could stop them they had seized Igor, and slain him.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav was at the edge of Chernigoff when news of Igor’s death came to him: “If
I had thought of this, I should have guarded him more carefully,” said he to his warriors.
“Men will say now that I wished to kill Igor, but God knows that I did not.” “Be not
concerned,” answered his warriors. “God knows, and people know, also, that not thou,
but his own cousins killed him; they who took an oath to thee, and then conspired
traitorously to kill thee.”
</p>
<p>Izyaslav seized Kursk, where he placed his son, Mystislav, and thus barred out the
Polovtsi. But Glaib, son of Yuri, came later with Sviatoslav to take the place. The
people would not raise a hand against Glaib, since he was a grandson of Monomach.
They would have fought against Sviatoslav had he come unassisted, as they informed
Mystislav, who returned to his father.
</p>
<p>Glaib, after installing posadniks, left that region, and the Polovtsi were free to
appear again. Rostislav of Smolensk led in large forces to help his brother, the Grand
Prince, and after an involved and tedious war, ending rather against Izyaslav than
for him, the Chernigoff princes were unable to continue the struggle; their territory
was stripped of provisions, and ruined in great part; they had no food for their warriors,
and could not pay Polovtsi allies. Yuri had sent a son with forces, but he would not
go with his main strength in person, and without Yuri the Chernigoff princes were
unable to stand against Izyaslav and his brothers.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>In such straits, they sent these words to Yuri: “Thou didst kiss the cross to go with
us against Izyaslav; thou hast not done so. Izyaslav came, burned our towns, took
our country. He came a second time; he burned and seized what he spared at the first
attack, but thou hast neither come to us nor fought against Izyaslav. If thy wish
is to march now against the Kief prince, we will go with thee; if not, we are freed
from our oath; we have no wish to perish in war unassisted.”
</p>
<p>From Yuri came no answer of value, hence they turned with proposals to the Kief prince.
He replied that he would consult with Rostislav and then answer finally. He consulted
with his brother for form’s sake, and then made peace with the princes of Chernigoff,
who took oath to forget Igor’s death, and be in friendship for the future. Kursk remained
in their possession.
</p>
<p>At this time Rostislav, Yuri’s eldest son, once prince in Novgorod, came to Kief,
declaring that he had quarreled with his father, who refused him land in Suzdal; hence
he had come to Izyaslav with homage. The Kief prince gave him those five towns held
formerly by Sviatoslav, son of Vsevolod, and also Gorodok, where Izyaslav did not
wish to see Yuri’s son Glaib, to whom he sent this command: “Find lands with the sons
of Oleg.”
</p>
<p>In autumn, the Grand Prince went to Gorodok, taking Rostislav with him. The sons of
David were there, but no son of Oleg. When Izyaslav mentioned this, the princes replied:
“We are here. It is indifferent whether they come or not; they and we took the oath
to make common cause with thee, and to go with thee against Yuri, starting when the
rivers should be frozen.” They who had been Yuri’s allies a short time before had
now become his enemies, and allies of Izyaslav. When the time came, Izyaslav left
Vladimir, his brother, in Kief, and visited Smolensk, to confer with Rostislav.
</p>
<p>Novgorod had assembled large forces to march against Yuri, and now sent many warriors,
as did Smolensk. They moved down the Volga, and, finding no trace of Yuri, ravaged
both sides of the river as far as Uglitch. Here news came that the sons of David,
with Sviatoslav, brother of Igor, had marched to assist them, but had halted in the
Vyatichi country to see who would be victor, the Kief prince, or Yuri.
</p>
<p>“Let them come or stay,” replied Izyaslav, and he sent Novgorod men and others to
take Yaroslavl on the Volga. This they <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>did after much effort, and returned with great booty. A week before Easter the weather
became so warm that the army could not remain in the country. Horses walked to their
bellies in water. Rostislav went back to Smolensk, and Izyaslav to Novgorod and thence
to his capital.
</p>
<p>This campaign cost Yuri’s country seven thousand men led away captives, besides all
the property burned and ruined. Upon Izyaslav’s return to Kief, he learned from his
boyars that Yuri’s son, Rostislav, had worked against him in his absence, and had
said to the people: “If God helps my father, he will visit Kief and take Izyaslav’s
house from him, and also his family.” “Send this traitor back to his father; thou
art keeping him here to thy ruin,” said the boyars. The prince summoned Rostislav,
and, without receiving him, gave this message: “Thou didst come to me and say that
thy father was unjust and would give thee no land. I took thee in as a brother, I
gave thee lands, and now thou wouldst seize Kief from me.” Yuri’s son sent back this
answer: “Neither in my heart nor my mind was the thought which thou hast mentioned.
If he who has lied is a prince I am ready to meet him, if of lower degree, either
Christian or pagan, judge thou between us.” “Ask no judgment of me,” replied Izyaslav.
“I know what thou wishest. Go back to thy father.”
</p>
<p>The boyars put Rostislav in a boat with three men and sent him up the river. His warriors
were retained, and his property taken.
</p>
<p>Rostislav bowed down to his father in Suzdal, and said: “The whole Russian land desires
thee. Men say in Kief that their prince has dishonored them. March thou against Izyaslav.”
These words imply clearly that Yuri’s son had worked with zeal against Izyaslav, and
that the complaint of the boyars was well founded.
</p>
<p>Such an “insult” to Rostislav greatly offended Yuri, who demanded angrily, “Is there
then no place for me or my sons in Russia?” He assembled his forces quickly, hired
Polovtsi, and was soon ready for action.
</p>
<p>It was not anger alone which roused Yuri; he believed that his day had come, the long
deferred day of triumph. His son’s report that he would find in the south serious
allies, decided his movements, and he marched forward with all speed. He had reached
the land of the Vyatichi, when Vladimir, son of David, warned Izyaslav, saying: “Be
ready for action; thy uncle is marching.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>Izyaslav prepared, and with the sons of David sent envoys to Sviatoslav, brother of
the late Igor, reminding him of their treaties.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav gave no answer at first, but guarded the envoys to keep men away from them.
Meanwhile he consulted with Yuri. “Art thou going against Izyaslav? Tell me truly
lest I ruin my lands without reason.” “I go, of course,” replied Yuri. “My nephew
made war in my lands and set fire to them. He drove out my son, and insulted me. I
will avenge the wrong done, or I will lay down my life.”
</p>
<p>On receiving this answer, Sviatoslav, unwilling to break his oath, without reasons
which men might hold sufficient, commanded his envoys to speak thus to Izyaslav: “Return
Igor’s property, and I will be with thee.” “Thou hast kissed the cross to put aside
enmity because of Igor and his property,” replied Izyaslav, “but now thou dost mention
them when my uncle is marching against me. Keep thy oath, or else break it.”
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav joined forces with Yuri. Yuri and Sviatoslav then sent the sons of David
a message, but they sent the answer only to Yuri: “In the last war thou didst swear
to be with us. But when Izyaslav took all our lands and burned the towns in them,
thou wouldst not come to us. Because of this we kissed the cross to Izyaslav, and
we cannot jest with salvation.”
</p>
<p>Yuri marched southward, expecting the Polovtsi and awaiting submission from Izyaslav,
his nephew. Rostislav of Smolensk, with large forces, hastened to strengthen his brother.
Yuri advanced to Pereyaslavl, thinking that Izyaslav might yield; but Izyaslav did
not yield. “If my uncle had come with his sons only,” said he, “he might have had
the best province in my possession, but as he leads in the hated Polovtsi, and with
them my enemy, I am forced to the field by his action.”
</p>
<p>Izyaslav talked thus to persuade Kief men to march against Yuri. They had insisted
on peace, and declared that they could not raise hands against a son of Monomach.
But, influenced by Izyaslav’s words, they at last consented to go, though unwillingly.
Crossing the Dnieper, the Grand Prince met Yuri’s army, the advance troops being Polovtsi,
and repulsed it. Then the two armies stood all day and night facing each other. In
the night Yuri sent to his nephew this message: “Thou hast ravaged my country, thou
hast taken seniority from me, but spare Christian <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>blood now. Let me seat a son in this city of Pereyaslavl, and rule thou in Kief. If
not, let God judge between us.”
</p>
<p>Izyaslav detained the envoy, and led out all his men to meet Yuri. Next morning the
bishop, with tears in his eyes, begged thus of Izyaslav: “Make peace with thy uncle.
If thou do so, thou wilt save the land from sore misery, and have great reward from
God.” But the prince would not listen. The armies were face to face that day till
evening, the river Trubej between them. At a council called by Izyaslav, some favored
crossing the river: “God gives thee the enemy; seize him,” said these men. “Remain
where thou art,” said others. “Thy uncle is wavering, he will vanish in the night.
Let him go, do not touch him.” The first advice pleased the prince, and he crossed
the river. Next day at noon the armies came very near fighting, but Yuri halted, and
in the evening withdrew. Again there were two minds in Izyaslav’s council: “Thy uncle
is fleeing,” urged one mind; “attack him before he escapes thee.” “Follow not,” urged
the other; “there will be no battle; thou wilt have victory for nothing.” This time
too Izyaslav took the first advice.
</p>
<p>At daybreak next morning the battle began. It was resolute at the opening and venomous
on both sides, but soon all of Izyaslav’s contingents from the Ros River fled. Seeing
this, the sons of David and the Kief men fled also. Pereyaslavl, persuaded already
by Yuri’s son, Rostislav, opened its gates without fighting, and thus the battle was
ended.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav had pierced an opposing regiment, but when in the rear of it he saw that
all had deserted him, and knew that nothing save flight remained. He reached Kief
with only two attendants, and went immediately to Volynia; but he withdrew to reopen
the struggle.
</p>
<p>On reaching Volynia Izyaslav sent to Poland, Bohemia and Hungary for aid. Aid was
promised, but he wished aid itself, and not promises, hence he sent envoys a second
time bearing rich presents, with the injunction to get what he asked for. Knowing
now what it was to fight against his uncle when the people were indifferent or opposed
to him, he sent these words to Yuri’s elder brother, Vyatcheslav: “Be my father and
take the throne of Kief; if not I will ruin thy country.”
</p>
<p>Vyatcheslav, alarmed by the threat, sent this message to Yuri: <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>“Make peace, defend my country, come hither thyself; we shall then see what to do.
If thou come not, I must act as seems best to me.” Yuri set out at once with his troops,
taking Polovtsi also. Izyaslav marched from Volynia against him. To Vyatcheslav came
Rostislav and Andrei, sons of Yuri, and soon Yuri himself came. Vladimirko of Galitch
moved to the boundary and thus checked Poles and Hungarians.
</p>
<p>The Poles, greatly alarmed by news from their own land that Prussian tribes were attacking
them, went home. Hence the allies sent these words to Yuri and Vyatcheslav: “Though
ye are as fathers to Izyaslav, ye are now warring against him. As Christians and brethren
we should all be united. Can you not arrange peace with your son and your brother?
Ye might remain in Kief. Ye yourselves know who should be there. Let Volynia and whatever
else is his go to Izyaslav. Let Yuri give back the Novgorod tribute.”
</p>
<p>“God reward you,” replied Yuri and his brother. “Since ye ask for peace and wish well
to us, let Izyaslav return to Volynia, and go ye to your own lands; we will discuss
then with Izyaslav.” The allies withdrew, and the uncles proposed terms to their nephew.
But the affair halted because Yuri’s eldest son and a nephew advised with great earnestness
not to make peace with Izyaslav. Yuri took this advice all the more readily, since
Izyaslav’s allies had gone to their own lands, and he thought it easy to force down
his nephew. “I will expel Izyaslav and take his lands,” said Yuri, and he moved with
his brother to do this.
</p>
<p>Yuri and his forces invested Lutsk, and for many weeks fought around the city. The
besieged lacked water greatly. Izyaslav strove to aid them, but Vladimirko of Galitch
barred the way; he desired victory for neither side. Volynia, independent of Kief,
was what he wished. Izyaslav sent to him, saying: “Reconcile me with my uncle Yuri.”
Vladimirko was willing, in fact he was very glad to attempt this.
</p>
<p>Andrei, Yuri’s second son, was for peace and counseled his father. “Give no ear to
my brother or cousin,” said he. “Make peace, O my father, do not ruin thy possessions.”
Vyatcheslav favored peace also. He had his own reasons for doing so. “Make peace,”
said he to Yuri. “If not, and thou go, Izyaslav will destroy my country.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>Yuri finally agreed to peace. His nephew yielded Kief, and Yuri gave back the Novgorod
tribute. Izyaslav visited his uncles, and all sides promised to return booty taken
since the action near Pereyaslavl. After that Yuri went back to Kief, and wished to
give it to Vyatcheslav, to whom it belonged by seniority, but the boyars dissuaded
him. “Thy brother could not hold Kief,” said they. “It will be neither his nor thine,
if thou yield it.” Yuri took his son from Vyshgorod, and gave the place to Vyatcheslav.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 1150, Izyaslav sent to find herds and property seized before peace was
concluded, but when his men had found what they were seeking, and asked for it, Yuri
refused it, and they went back empty-handed. Thereupon Izyaslav sent a complaint and
threat to his uncle: “Keep thy oath, for I cannot remain thus offended.” Yuri made
no answer, and Izyaslav took arms again, urged, as was said, by Kief people.
</p>
<p>At this time Yuri’s son Glaib was encamped not far from Izyaslav, who suddenly attacked
him in the night. Glaib escaped with much difficulty, having lost everything he had.
Next day he sent to his cousin this message: “Yuri is my father, so art thou, and
I render thee homage. Thou and Yuri will settle all questions. But give thy oath that
thou wilt permit me to visit my father. If thou do, I will come and bow down to thee.”
Izyaslav gave the oath. Glaib went to Yuri, and Izyaslav hastened to the steppe to
get aid from the Black Caps, who rejoiced with unbounded delight when they saw him.
</p>
<p>Yuri, on hearing that his nephew had gone to the Black Caps, left Kief at once, crossed
the Dnieper and hastened to Gorodok. As soon as Yuri withdrew from Kief, Vyatcheslav
entered. The Kief people went out in great crowds to meet Izyaslav, who was not slow
in coming. “Yuri has left us,” said they. “Vyatcheslav is in the palace, but we do
not want him. Go to Holy Sophia, and then take the throne of thy fathers.” “I gave
thee Kief,” said Izyaslav, in a message to his uncle, “but thou wouldst not take it.
Now when thy brother has fled, thou art willing. Go to thy Vyshgorod.” “Even shouldst
thou kill me for staying, I would not go,” answered Vyatcheslav.
</p>
<p>Taking a few attendants, Izyaslav went to his uncle and bowed down before him. Vyatcheslav
rose, kissed him and they sat down together. “Father,” said Izyaslav, “I give thee
homage, <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>I cannot do what thou wishest, such is the power of the people. They are opposed to
thee. Go to Vyshgorod; from there we two will manage.” “When thou didst invite me
to Kief,” answered Vyatcheslav, “I had kissed the cross to Yuri. If Kief is thine
now, I will go to Vyshgorod.” And he went.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Yuri called on the sons of David and Oleg for assistance, and Vladimirko
was marching from the west. Izyaslav, greatly alarmed, prepared for defense very promptly
and went with boyars to Vyatcheslav in Vyshgorod. “Take Kief,” said he to his uncle,
“and with it what lands thou desirest; the rest leave to me.” Vyatcheslav was offended
at first. “Why didst thou not give me Kief when thou wert forcing me out of it shamefully?”
asked he. “Now when one army is moving against thee from Galitch and another from
Chernigoff, thou givest me my inheritance.” “I offered thee Kief, declaring that I
could live with thee, but not with Yuri,” said Izyaslav. “Thee I love as my father.
And I say now again: Thou art my father, and Kief belongs to thee.” These words softened
Vyatcheslav and he kissed the cross to consider Izyaslav as his son, and Izyaslav
swore to regard him as a father. “I am going to Zvenigorod against Vladimirko,” said
Izyaslav. “Be pleased thou to enter Kief and let me have thy warriors.” “I will send
all of my warriors with thee,” replied Vyatcheslav.
</p>
<p>Vladimirko was now in the field to help Yuri, and Izyaslav marched westward at once
to hasten the struggle, but when he came near the enemy his men forsook him. “Vladimirko
has a countless host,” cried they. “Do not destroy us and forfeit thy own life. Wait
till another time.” “Better die here than suffer disgrace such as that!” exclaimed
Izyaslav. Nevertheless all fled the field, and the Kief prince was left with only
his personal following. He fell back on the capital safely, though he might have been
captured. Vladimirko thought the whole movement a strategy, hence he followed on cautiously,
looking for ambushes everywhere. Izyaslav found his uncle in Kief, waiting anxiously.
They counseled awhile and then sat down to dinner. During dinner news came that Yuri
was crossing the Dnieper, and with him the men of Chernigoff. “This is not our day!”
exclaimed the two princes, and they fled from Kief, Vyatcheslav going to Vyshgorod,
and Izyaslav back to Volynia.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next day Vladimirko and Yuri met outside Kief and greeted each other on horseback.
The Galitch prince visited all the holy places in the city, and then bade farewell
to his father-in-law in friendship. He took with him Yuri’s son, Mystislav, and installed
that prince on the boundary of Volynia. Later on Yuri gave this whole region to his
best son, Andrei.
</p>
<p>Andrei fixed his camp in Peresopnitsa, and during the winter Izyaslav sent an envoy
to him. “Reconcile me with thy father,” said he. “My inheritance is not in Hungary
or Poland. Ask from thy father the return of my land on the Goryn.” He sent this request,
but bade his envoy look sharply at all things. He was planning to fall on Andrei,
as he had fallen on Glaib, Yuri’s other son, some time earlier.
</p>
<p>The envoy found everything in excellent order, and a strong force of warriors in readiness.
Andrei, unsuspicious, or feigning to be so, turned to Yuri in favor of Izyaslav, but
Yuri would not yield a whit to his nephew. “My uncle,” declared Izyaslav, “would drive
me to exile. Vladimirko of Galitch has taken my land at command of Yuri, and is now
making ready to march on Vladimir, my capital.” So he sent Vladimir, his brother,
to Hungary to ask aid of the king, who marched straightway with an army on Galitch.
“I, thy brother, have started,” wrote the king. “Join me at once with thy forces.
Vladimirko will see the men whom he has offended.”
</p>
<p>Vladimirko had friends in Hungary, who sent him information, hence he left Bailz,
where his camp was, and hastened forward to meet the Hungarian forces at Peremysl.
There he discovered that he was no match for the king in the field, so he begged the
archbishop and two bishops from Hungary with certain influential boyars to help him.
He lavished gold without stint on these prelates and boyars, and they in return urged
the king to go home and make war at another time. He yielded, and sent this explanation
to Izyaslav: “The Greek Emperor is moving against me; I must return to my own country
to meet him, but next summer I can send ten thousand men, or even more if thou need
them.”
</p>
<p>The Hungarian force vanished, and was as if it had never seen Galitch. Izyaslav, foiled
for the moment by his enemy, sent Vladimir a second time to Hungary with this message:
“Vyatcheslav’s boyars, the people and the steppe tribes have sent for me. <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>If thou must stay at home to prepare for the Greek Emperor, send me the aid which
thou hast promised, and I will be with thee hereafter at all times.” The king sent
him now ten thousand men, and with these warriors he set out against Kief.
</p>
<p>On the way news was brought to him that Vladimirko was following. A council was summoned,
and the boyars spoke thus: “Thou art marching on Yuri, and Vladimirko is pursuing;
our position is perilous.” “Ye have come out of Kief,” replied Izyaslav; “ye have
lost land and property, ye have lost all. I have lost my inheritance. I must get back
my own and win yours in the same effort. If Vladimirko comes, God will decide between
us. If Yuri should meet me, the Lord will judge also in his case.” And leaving Sviatopolk,
one of his brothers, behind in Vladimir, his capital, to guard the place, he moved
forward with the Hungarians and his own men.
</p>
<p>On the way Vladimirko was joined by Andrei, and both forces followed together. Though
sometimes at skirmishing distance, Izyaslav wisely abstained from action, and sent
on Vladimir to Bailgorod, where Boris, son of Yuri, was feasting. If a collector of
taxes had not raised the bridge, Boris would have been seized at table. Unable to
get possession of the place without a battle, Vladimir rejoined Izyaslav, and they
hastened on toward Kief. When Vladimirko’s men came up, they approached and sounded
a trumpet. People ran out and lowered the bridge willingly. This advance force entered
Bailgorod, and Boris hurried away to his father. Yuri, greatly alarmed by the strength
of the enemy marching against him, left Kief at once, crossed the Dnieper, fled on,
and took refuge in Gorodok.
</p>
<p>All Kief went out to meet Izyaslav. The delight of the people this time seemed real.
Yuri, whom the city never really liked, had become most unpopular, and they now rejoiced
to be rid of him.
</p>
<p>On the west, beyond Bailgorod, Vladimirko and Andrei were manœuvering for battle with
Izyaslav, when suddenly news reached them that their enemy was in Kief with his forces,
and Yuri powerless in Gorodok. Vladimirko’s rage was unbounded. “I cannot see how
my father-in-law manages,” said he to Andrei. “I cannot understand how ye, his sons,
help him. Thou, Andrei, hadst thy camp on the Goryn; Boris was in Bailgorod. We might
have <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>forced Izyaslav to action and lamed, or defeated him, but Boris left us and gave the
road to our enemy. Thy father then abandoned Kief, and Izyaslav is now Grand Prince.
To-day the whole Russian land is on his side. I leave you, and go now to Galitch.”
</p>
<p>Yuri had no friends in the south, where all had hoped for his downfall. The campaign
seemed indeed like some folk-tale. A battle might have ruined Izyaslav; a quick march
secured him dominion.
</p>
<p>Vladimirko turned home, but to each town he said as he came to it: “Give me the silver
and gold that I ask of you. If ye refuse I will take what I find at the sword’s point.”
No town or city had the silver or gold, or the coin or utensils to meet this demand
of Yuri’s ally, hence people were forced to take every ornament from the necks and
the arms of their women, and give them to the master of Galitch. Vladimirko took from
all in this way till he reached his own boundary.
</p>
<p>At last the hour of triumph had sounded for Yuri’s simple-minded brother. On the day
after his entrance to Kief, Izyaslav sent this message to his uncle: “I salute thee,
my father. I have sinned before thee, but I repent. I have sinned a first, and a second,
and a third time. I repent now of all these transgressions, and, if thou forgive,
God will pardon me. I give thee Kief; come thou and sit on the throne of thy fathers.”
Thus Izyaslav acknowledged completely the right of uncles as opposed to the sons of
their elder brothers, a right against which even personal qualities, or the respect
of people availed not.
</p>
<p>“God give thee strength, my son,” replied Vyatcheslav, “because thou hast given me
due honor. It was thy duty thus to act long ago. Thou hast given honor to God by the
honor given me. Thou sayest that I am thy father; I say that thou art my son. I have
no son, and thou hast no father; thou art my son, thou art also my brother.”
</p>
<p>Uncle and nephew now kissed the cross to each other not to part in defeat or in triumph.
The Hungarians were feasted, received rich presents, and went home. The two princes
sent Izyaslav’s son on a mission to Hungary, to assure the Hungarian king of the Kief
princes’ gratitude, and to make offer of service, asking, too, that if the need came
the king would send troops, as he had sent them recently. Rostislav of Smolensk was
invited to aid in liberating <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>Kief, for they thought, and thought rightly, that Yuri would not yield without a struggle.
</p>
<p>Yuri now summoned all his allies. Sviatoslav moved promptly and met Vladimir, son
of David, in Chernigoff; then their forces sailed down in boats to Gorodok, where
they joined Yuri. Izyaslav, the other son of David, joined the Kief princes. Rostislav
of Smolensk came to Kief early with his forces. Yuri moved with his allies from Gorodok
to the Dnieper and strove hard to cross, but was foiled in each effort by his nephew.
Strengthened now by large forces of the Polovtsi, he marched toward the south and
crossed at the second ford, below Kief, then turning back, he advanced on the capital.
Izyaslav and his uncle, disposing their men in the city and around it, waited for
the coming conflict.
</p>
<p>“We are now ready for battle,” said Vyatcheslav to his nephews. “Yuri is my brother,
though younger, and I wish to bring my seniority before him. God in his judgment considers
the right side.” So he summoned an envoy and gave these instructions: “Go thou to
Yuri, my brother: bow down to him in my name and say these words from me: ‘I have
said often to thee, Yuri, and to Izyaslav, shed not Christian blood, ruin not the
Russian land. I have tried to restrain thee from war. I have regiments and power of
my own which God gave me. Still I have not fought for myself, though thou, Yuri, and
also Izyaslav have deeply offended me, not one time, but many. Izyaslav, when going
to fight against Igor, said that he was not seeking Kief for himself, but for me,
his father. Then, when God gave him victory, he kept Kief for himself, and took also
Turoff and Pinsk from me. That is how Izyaslav offended, but I, keeping Christians
in mind and the Russian land, did not remember it against him. Thou, brother Yuri,
when going to Pereyaslavl to fight against Izyaslav, didst say: “I seek not Kief for
myself. I have an older brother who is to me as a father; I am seeking Kief for that
brother.” But, when God aided thee to take Kief, thou didst keep it. Thou didst seize
from me, besides, Dorogobuj and Peresopnitsa, and gavest me only Vyshgorod. Thus did
ye wrong me. All this time I sought no redress out of love for the Russian land and
for Christians. Ye would take no decision of mine; ye sought war. I strove to dissuade
thee from war, but ye would not listen. Thy answer was that thou couldst not give
homage to a junior. But Izyaslav, though he has failed <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>twice before in his word to me, has given now what is mine; he has yielded up Kief,
and calls me father. Thou hast said: “I cannot bow down to a junior.” I am older than
thou not a little; I was bearded before thou wert born. If it is thy wish to defy
my seniority, God will render judgment.’ ”
</p>
<p>To this Yuri answered: “I bow down to thee, brother; thy words are true, and well
spoken. Thou art to me in the place of a father, and if it is thy desire to arrange
matters clearly, let Izyaslav go to Volynia and Rostislav return to Smolensk. I will
settle all questions then with thee.” “Brother Yuri, this is what I will say in answer,”
retorted Vyacheslav. “Thou hast seven sons, and I do not hunt them away from thee.
I have two adopted sons, Izyaslav and Rostislav, with some others still younger. I
will add this: Do thou for the good of the Russian land and of Christians go to Pereyaslavl,
thence to Kursk with thy sons, and beyond is Rostoff, thy great inheritance. Send
home the sons of Oleg. After that we will settle, and shed no Christian blood. But
if thou must have thy own way, the Purest Lady and her Son will judge between us.”
</p>
<p>Yuri gave no answer to these words, but next morning he appeared before Kief with
his forces. There was nothing but skirmishing till toward evening, when a part of
each army engaged. The Kief troops drove back their opponents, and fought with such
vigor that Yuri withdrew his whole force and marched westward to meet Vladimirko,
his ally from Galitch, who, as he heard, was now hastening to join him. He appeared
before Bailgorod, from which his son Boris had fled some time previously, and summoning
the citizens, said: “Ye are my people, open the gates to me.” “Has Kief opened its
gates?” was the answer. The gates remained closed, and Yuri marched farther. The Kief
princes set out in pursuit and overtook him near Rut River, beyond Bailgorod. There
they strove again to make peace, but failed, since the sons of Oleg and the Polovtsi
opposed it.
</p>
<p>As they could not come to terms, the Kief princes were anxious to force a battle before
Vladimirko could strengthen their enemy. Yuri wished to defer the engagement till
Vladimirko could join him. His first intention was to pass Rut River, prevent the
Kief troops from crossing, and wait for his ally in a favorable position. But all
his movements to gain time were useless, and he was compelled <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>to turn promptly to battle. Andrei, now Yuri’s eldest son, for Rostislav had died
recently, ranged his father’s warriors in order of battle. “Thou hast striven much
for the good,” said Izyaslav and his brother to Vyatcheslav, “but thy brother opposes
at all times. We are willing, if need be, to lay down our lives to save thy rights
for thee.” “My sons,” replied the old man, “I have been opposed all my life to bloodshed.
We are on this field to-day because of Yuri. God will judge between him and me.”
</p>
<p>Andrei advanced in the front rank, led the battle, and made the first lance cast.
His lance broke, his shield was torn from him, his helmet was shivered, and he fell
from the horse, which was wounded under him. Izyaslav also engaged in the front rank;
thrown from his horse, he fell and was lost among the slain and wounded.
</p>
<p>The battle was brief, but decisive. Izyaslav’s men fought willingly this time, while
Yuri’s showed no heart in the struggle. His Polovtsi fled without using an arrow.
After them fled the sons of Oleg, and next Yuri himself and his sons. Many prisoners
were taken, many men slain. Among the slain was Vladimir, son of David, Prince of
Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>When the victors, returning, passed over the field after hunting their fugitive opponents,
they saw a man trying to rise from a great pile of dead and wounded. Some foot warriors
ran up and struck him. “I am a prince!” he was able to say. “Thou art the man we are
seeking,” cried they, and slashed at his helmet, thinking him a son of Oleg, or David.
“I am Izyaslav. I am your prince,” called he to them. They raised him then with gladness,
and praised the Lord, who had saved him.
</p>
<p>The Kief princes urged Izyaslav, son of David, to take his brother’s corpse, hasten
with all the strength in him to Chernigoff, and sit on the throne before Sviatoslav
could forestall him. (This was a real case of running for office.)
</p>
<p>From the battlefield Yuri fled to the Dnieper, which he crossed, and then sped forward
to Pereyaslavl for refuge. Sviatoslav fled to Gorodok, but as the son of Oleg was
enormous in person, and mortally weary from fighting and fleeing, he could not move
farther, though eager to do so. If he had had wings and could have used them, he would
have flown through the air to Chernigoff; as it was, he sent forward his nephew, son
of Vsevolod, who learned <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>at the Desna that Izyaslav, son of David, was already on the throne. Vladimirko of
Galitch, on hearing of his father-in-law’s defeat, hastened homeward.
</p>
<p>At last Vyatcheslav and his nephew were in safety on all sides. They returned to Kief,
which they entered in triumph, and held the place with pleasure, at least for the
moment.
</p>
<p>Vladimirko of Galitch now dealt a sore blow at his enemies. Having heard that Mystislav,
son of Izyaslav the Kief prince, was bringing in Hungarians, he lay in wait to destroy
them. He found means to place a great quantity of wine within reach of the foreigners
and they seized it and had a rich feast that evening. Just before daybreak Vladimirko
attacked and slew nearly all of them, reserving but few for captivity. Mystislav escaped
with his personal attendants. “If God give health to the king, and to me,” said Izyaslav,
when he heard of the slaughter, “Vladimirko will pay for this dearly.”
</p>
<p>Yuri, still in Pereyaslavl, was inciting Vladimirko, and collecting fresh Polovtsi,
so the Kief princes marched to expel him. After fighting two days before the town,
on the third they burned its outskirts and sent these words to Yuri: “We salute thee.
Go thou to Suzdal. Leave a son in Pereyaslavl. We may not leave thee there; thou wouldst
bring in Polovtsi.” Yuri could get no aid from Vladimirko or the Polovtsi. His own
forces were greatly decreased, and he would not weaken Suzdal, hence he returned this
answer: “I will march to Gorodok, remain there a time, and go afterward to Suzdal.”
To this the reply was that he might remain one month in Gorodok, and then he must
go to Suzdal. If he would not agree to this, they would attack Gorodok, as they had
attacked Pereyaslavl. There was no escape now, so, though unwilling, Yuri and his
son kissed the cross to go in one month to Suzdal. He promised also to make no attack
on Kief while it was held by Izyaslav and his uncle, and his uncle made no treaty
with Sviatoslav, son of Oleg.
</p>
<p>Leaving his son Glaib in Pereyaslavl, Yuri went to Gorodok. Andrei, his eldest son,
begged to go in advance to Suzdal. “We have naught now in this place,” said he to
his father. Sviatoslav, hearing that Yuri had agreed with Vyatcheslav and his nephew,
sent to Izyaslav, son of David, in his own name and in that of Sviatoslav, son of
Vsevolod, asking for what had belonged to their <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>fathers. Izyaslav gave those lands to them, but on condition of their leaving Yuri,
and acting with the sons of Mystislav.
</p>
<p>Yuri had not the heart to go home with defeat, and when the month had passed, and
the time came to go to Suzdal he broke his oath and remained in Gorodok. Izyaslav
with his warriors, the Prince of Chernigoff with his men, also the son of Vsevolod
promptly moved against him. The son of Oleg sent his forces, but would not appear
himself against his old ally. Yuri shut himself up in the place and fought, but at
last he grew weary; he could not win victory alone, and no help was visible on any
side. He was forced finally to swear again that he would go back to Suzdal. He went
this time, and left his son Glaib in Gorodok. Because of the Gorodok oath breaking,
Pereyaslavl had been taken from Glaib, and given to Mystislav, son of the Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>On the way home, Yuri stopped to see his friend Sviatoslav, son of Oleg, who received
him with honor and gave him things needed for his journey. This friendly visit caused,
very likely, the meeting between the princes of Kief and Chernigoff in 1152 (Sviatoslav,
son of Vsevolod, was present at this meeting), at which they decided to deprive Yuri
of his foothold between the South and Chernigoff. Then they razed Gorodok, fired the
ruins and consumed the place utterly. They left not one thing on the site of it.
</p>
<p>“Yuri sighed from his heart,” as the chronicler states, when he heard of this destruction,
and began at once to rally his forces. Rostislav of Ryazan came with his brother;
Sviatoslav, son of Oleg, broke his treaty with the Kief prince and came to aid Yuri.
A great host of Polovtsi appeared from all hordes between the Don and the Volga. An
immense army assembled. “They burned my Gorodok,” said Yuri, “and also the church
in it. I will burn their cities in return.” And he marched on Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>The Kief prince sent this message at once to his brother in Smolensk: “If Yuri moves
against thy land, I will hasten to aid thee. If he passes thee, do thou hurry hither
with warriors.” Rostislav saw that Yuri, when passing Smolensk lands, would strike
at Chernigoff, so marching with speed he reached Chernigoff before his uncle, and
shut himself in there with Sviatoslav, son of Vsevolod. Polovtsi legions appeared
that same day, and fell straightway to burning the suburbs.
</p>
<p>Yuri himself with his allies came in sight the next morning. <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>Twelve days and nights did the Suzdal prince struggle with the city but the defense
was so stubborn that he seized nothing, mastered no part of Chernigoff. On the thirteenth
morning came news that Vyatcheslav and Izyaslav were hurriedly approaching with all
the Kief forces. The Polovtsi, active at looting and burning, fled when they saw that
real fighting and danger were near them, and Yuri was forced to withdraw. He went
first to Novgorod, then to Rylsk, and was about to start for Suzdal when the son of
Oleg reproached him as follows: “Thou art leaving me when thou hast ruined my property.
All the grain in this land has been trampled by Polovtsi. Thy Polovtsi have fled,
and thou thyself art deserting. After thee will come Izyaslav, and he will destroy
what remains here because I broke faith with him, and gave thee assistance.” Yuri
engaged to leave troops, but his words were merely vain promises. He left only fifty
men of his guard, and Vassilko, his son, to protect all that country.
</p>
<p>At Novgorod appeared Izyaslav, with his allies. In three days he was master of all
save the innermost fortress. Sviatoslav, son of Oleg, asked then for peace, which
the Kief prince wished at first to refuse, but he granted it finally and returned
to Chernigoff. There he received news from his son, Mystislav, that he had overtaken
and crushed Yuri’s Polovtsi, freed a great number of captives and recovered much booty.
Yuri made still another effort, but a weaker one and his defeat was decisive.
</p>
<p>Thus ended Izyaslav’s struggle with his uncle. Yuri’s main ally, Sviatoslav, was reduced
to take gladly the place that was given him. There remained still another of Yuri’s
assistants, the last one, his son-in-law, Vladimirko of Galitch, and to him Izyaslav
now turned his attention.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">ANDREI BOGOLYUBOFF</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1151 the Kief prince and King Geiza of Hungary attacked Vladimirko near Peremysl,
where, though hemmed in by the armies, he managed to escape to the town with a single
attendant. He informed the king straightway, that, mortally wounded and dying, he
begged him for peace and forgiveness. He sent also, through agents, great presents
and bribes to Geiza’s attendants and to the archbishop. “Let me not die without peace
or pardon,” implored he. “Great is my sin, but forgive me.”
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all protests from Izyaslav, peace and pardon were granted, Vladimirko
promising to return the towns seized from Izyaslav, and to be his ally, both in defeat
and in triumph. Vladimirko was lying in bed, as if mortally wounded, and seemed to
dread his last hour, then approaching.
</p>
<p>When King Geiza was sending officials with a cross, which the dying man was to kiss,
Izyaslav objected with anger. “That man jests with every oath,” said he. “It is vain
to send a cross to Vladimirko.” “This is the very wood on which died Christ our Lord,”
explained Geiza. “By God’s will it came to Saint Stephen, my ancestor. If Vladimirko
kisses this cross, survives, and breaks his oath, I will lay down my life, or capture
Galitch and give it to thee. I cannot kill a man on his death-bed.”
</p>
<p>Izyaslav yielded, but Mystislav, his son, who was present, added these words: “He
will break the oath surely, and I repeat here before this holy cross, forget not thy
word, O King of Hungary, but come again with thy warriors to Galitch, and do what
thou hast promised.”
</p>
<p>“If Vladimirko breaks his oath,” replied Geiza, “I will ask thy father to help me
in Galitch, as he has asked me up to this time.” Vladimirko kissed the cross to do
all that he had promised.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>On his way home Izyaslav sent posadniks to take possession of the towns which were
to be returned to him. These men came back quickly with news that not one town had
been given to them—one half of the oath was now broken. On learning that Yuri was
marching against Izyaslav, Vladimirko at once sent troops to help Yuri, and thus broke
the rest of his oath. He returned home only when the Grand Prince was marching against
him a second time.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav sent Borislavitch, his boyar, who had witnessed the oath on the holy cross
of Saint Stephen, to demand the towns promised. “Say to Izyaslav,” said the Galitch
prince, “that he attacked me unawares and perfidiously, that he brought a foreign
king with him, and that I will either lay down my life, or avenge the wrong done me.”
“But, thou hast taken an oath to the king and to Izyaslav,” said the boyar. “Wilt
thou foreswear the cross?” “Oh, that little cross!” retorted Vladimirko. “Though that
cross be small it is mighty,” said the boyar. “Men have told thee that Christ the
Lord died on that wood, and that thou wouldst not live if thy promises were broken.
Dost remember?” “I remember that ye spoke many words to me then, but leave this place
now and go back to thy Izyaslav.”
</p>
<p>While the boyar was leaving the courtyard, Vladimirko started for vespers, but halted
to ridicule him. When, on his way back from the church, the prince reached the spot
where he had stood to revile Borislavitch, he call out on a sudden: “Some one has
struck me on the shoulder!” He could not move his legs, and would have fallen had
men not seized him. He was borne to his chambers and placed at once in a hot bath,
but he grew rapidly worse, and died that same night.
</p>
<p>Borislavitch, who had passed the night at a village by the wayside, was roused hurriedly
next morning at daybreak, and bidden to wait till the prince should recall him. Some
hours later a second message came, asking him to return. When he reappeared at Vladimirko’s
palace, servants clothed in black came out to meet him. In the chief seat was Yaroslav,
son of Vladimirko, dressed in black; his boyars also were in black, every man of them.
Yaroslav burst into tears as he looked at the envoy, who learned at once how Vladimirko
had died in the night, though in perfect health a few hours earlier. “God has shown
his will,” <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>said Yaroslav; “thou art called back to hear these words from me. Go thou to Izyaslav,
bow down to him and say from me: ‘God has taken my father, be thou in his place. There
were questions between thee and him, those questions the Lord will judge as he pleases.
God has taken my father and left me here in place of him. His warriors and attendants
are all at my order. I salute thee, O father, receive me as thou dost Mystislav, thy
son. Let him ride at one of thy stirrups, and I with my forces will ride at the other.’ ”
</p>
<p>The boyar went home with this message, which seems to have been sent to win time and
lull Izyaslav, for no towns were returned, and all things remained as they had been.
</p>
<p>Hence, in 1153, the Grand Prince again moved against Galitch. The two forces met at
Terebovl, but the battle was strangely indecisive as to victory, though its results
were more useful to Yaroslav than to the Grand Prince. One part of the Kief force
defeated one part of Yaroslav’s army, while the other part of those forces was badly
beaten and pursued by the Galitch men. Izyaslav, impetuous as usual, broke the ranks
of his opponents and drove them far from the first place of onset, but his brothers
and allies were beaten, and hopelessly scattered.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav, having no forces with which to continue the struggle, returned to Kief and
abandoned all plans against Galitch. Some months later he married a Georgian princess,
and died shortly after, 1154. Kief and the south mourned greatly for this prince,
and most of all mourned Vyatcheslav his uncle. “Thou art where I ought to be, but
against God all are powerless,” sobbed the old man, bending over the coffin.
</p>
<p>If in Kief men were saddened by this death, they rejoiced in Chernigoff immensely.
Izyaslav, son of David, who yearned for Kief as a man yearns for her of whom he is
desperately enamoured, set out for the city at once, but was stopped at the Dnieper
by Vyatcheslav, who sent this inquiry: “Why hast thou come? Who has called thee? Go
back to thy Chernigoff.” “I wish to weep over my cousin. I was far from him when he
died. Let me weep at his coffin,” implored Izyaslav. By the advice of the boyars,
and the son of the dead prince, this request was rejected. They dared not trust the
son of David, and were waiting impatiently for Rostislav to take the place of his
brother.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>Prompt action was taken meanwhile to divide the Chernigoff cousins. Vyatcheslav sent
for Sviatoslav, son of Vsevolod, who came at once, without knowledge of his uncle’s
death. The Smolensk prince appeared at the earliest moment, and all felt relieved
when Rostislav sat in the place of his brother, as a son and subordinate of Vyatcheslav,
the Grand Prince, though really commanding. “Act,” said the Kief men, “as did thy
brother, and Kief will be thine till thy death hour.”
</p>
<p>The first act of Rostislav was a settlement with Sviatoslav, son of Vsevolod. “I give
thee Turoff and Pinsk,” said he to this nephew, “because thou didst come to my father,
I give thee good lands for that act of thine.” Sviatoslav took this large gift with
gladness. There was need to attach him firmly, since his uncles of Chernigoff were
treating already with Yuri, whose son Glaib was now marching on Pereyaslavl with a
strong force of Polovtsi. Rostislav sent his son straightway to that city with assistance.
The Polovtsi had attacked, but at sight of Kief warriors they withdrew beyond the
Sula. Rostislav resolved then to march on Chernigoff, and crossing the Dnieper he
was ready to move forward when a courier galloped up with the message: “Vyatcheslav,
thy uncle, is dead!”
</p>
<p>After the prince had been interred with great honor, Rostislav went back to the army
and held a council: “Return to the capital,” said the Kief boyars, who wished to be
sure of the offices. “Settle there with the people, and begin to rule anew well supported.
If Yuri comes, make peace or war, as need dictates.” Rostislav did not take their
advice, but moved on Chernigoff, sending this message first to Izyaslav, son of David:
“Wilt thou kiss the cross to reign in Chernigoff, while I am in Kief?” “I know not
what I have done to make thee march against me. If thou come, we shall have that which
God gives,” was the answer.
</p>
<p>But this far-seeing son of David had sent Polovtsi under Glaib to Pereyaslavl, and
was in fact warring at that time with Rostislav. He now joined Glaib with great promptness.
Rostislav, finding no zeal in Kief boyars, and thinking himself outnumbered and powerless,
lost courage, and discussed terms of peace with the son of David. Such indecision
roused Mystislav, son of the recent Grand Prince, who left his uncle with these words:
“Soon neither thou nor I will have any place.” Rostislav, deserted by his nephew,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>and outflanked by the Polovtsi, fought two days, and then fled, saving his life with
much difficulty. The Polovtsi turned now toward Kief, which they threatened. “I wish
to go to you,” was the message sent by Izyaslav to Kief citizens. The capital was
helpless, Izyaslav was the one man to save it. “Come thou to Kief, lest the Polovtsi
take us. Thou art our prince, come at once,” was the quick answer.
</p>
<p>Izyaslav needed no second call. He appeared, took the throne of Kief, and sent Glaib,
son of Yuri, to Pereyaslavl. When Yuri heard that Izyaslav, his nephew, was dead,
and that Rostislav, his other nephew, was in Kief, he set out with strong forces immediately,
and was nearing Smolensk, for which he intended the first blow, when he learned that
Vyatcheslav, his brother, was dead; that Rostislav was defeated, that Izyaslav, son
of David, was reigning in Kief, and Glaib his own son, was prince in Pereyaslavl.
</p>
<p>Rostislav, who had reached Smolensk and had collected men, was marching to meet Yuri.
Each now wished peace with the other. Yuri was hastening to Kief, which he coveted
beyond everything else. Rostislav, who had no desire at that juncture for Kief, was
glad to agree with his uncle, and they made peace with apparent sincerity. Yuri continued
his march toward Kief, and Rostislav retired to his own capital. Near Storodub, Yuri
met his old ally, Sviatoslav, son of Oleg, with whom was Vsevolod’s son, Sviatoslav,
who appeared now with a prayer for reinstatement. “In days past I lost my mind altogether.
Forgive me.” These were his words to Yuri. The son of Oleg interceded, and Yuri gave
pardon, making Sviatoslav kiss the cross not to desert either him, or the son of Oleg.
All three set out then for Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>Before reaching that city the son of Oleg sent the Kief prince this message: “Go out
of Kief, brother, Yuri is marching against thee.” Izyaslav was unwilling to leave
Kief. A second message came, but he took no note of it. Thereupon Yuri sent these
words: “Kief is my inheritance, not thine.” Without right, and without the special
favor of the people, Izyaslav could not remain, so he answered: “I am here not of
my own will; the Kief people sent for me. Kief is thine, but harm me not.” Yuri made
peace with him and entered Kief, 1155, with four sons, whom he seated in regions about
there,—Andrei in Vyshgorod, Boris in Turoff; Vassilko in the Ros country, and Glaib
remained in Pereyaslavl.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus the succession of Kief fell at last to the oldest man of the family. The heirs
of Mystislav the Great could not stand against the seniority of Yuri their uncle.
David’s descendants had dropped out still earlier; those of Oleg had perished. Yuri’s
seniority now received perfect recognition; he had broken through every claim and
given victory once more to the right of seniority. Once more and for the last time
appeared a perfect reëstablishment of the old regime of Kief dominion, but in the
person of Yuri it ended forever. In this was the fateful position of the last son
of Monomach: Yuri Dolgoruki stood on the very line dividing the old from the new time
in Russia. Even in the early days of this unresisted establishment of Yuri in Kief,
there was dissatisfaction, for it was quickly manifest how unacquainted he was with
the state of things there, and with the minds of the people. Though perhaps not wantonly
cruel, according to the standards of that age, he was grasping and selfish, but as
his grandfather, Monomach, was the most popular prince in Russian history, and Mystislav
the Great, his father, was second only to the renowned Monomach, he, Dolgoruki, was
endured as Prince of Kief, because of his family position. He held the office until
death came to him, two years later, 1157, just before an effort was to have been made
to expel him.
</p>
<p>Yuri, when he became Grand Prince, wishing to keep Andrei near him, had given this
favorite son the fortified town of Vyshgorod, fifteen versts distant from Kief, but
Andrei was ambitious, and soon became dissatisfied with his humble and dependent position.
Therefore he left Vyshgorod secretly and went to Vladimir, his birthplace, taking
with him all his belongings and the miraculous image of the Mother of God painted,
according to legend, by Saint Luke, and greatly valued by Russians.
</p>
<p>This holy image had been brought from Tsargrad to Kief, especially for Yuri, and he
had placed it in a cathedral in <span class="corr" id="xd32e1191" title="Source: Vyschgorod">Vyshgorod</span>.
</p>
<p>When Andrei, with the help of the monks, secured the image, he intended to place it
in a church in Rostoff, but after leaving Vladimir, and when ten versts beyond that
city, the horses drawing the vehicle containing the holy image stopped suddenly, and
could not be made to cross the river. Several times the horses were changed, but with
no result. Thereupon Andrei declared to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>people present that the previous night the Mother of God had appeared to him in a
vision with a charter in her hand, and had told him to put her image in a church in
Vladimir.
</p>
<p>The procession turned back at once, and the image was placed in the Vladimir church.
Andrei commanded a church and monastery to be built on the spot where the Virgin had
made herself manifest. He called this place Bogolyuboff, which means the love of God,
and from it he received his own name later on. Henceforth all deeds of valor and prowess,
and successes of every kind were ascribed to the miraculous image.
</p>
<p>Yuri did not urge Andrei to return to Vyshgorod, nor did he insist upon his restoring
the holy painting. Andrei could not have done so, in any case, for all people believed
that the Mother of God had selected Vladimir as the home of her image.
</p>
<p>After Yuri’s death his territory was divided, and Mystislav assumed the title of Grand
Prince of Kief, though in reality there ceased to be any Grand Principality of Kief.
</p>
<p>Born in the north, the city of Vladimir was dear to Andrei. Only through necessity
did he go from it to serve in the various wars waged by his father. From youth, Andrei
was famous as a warrior, and was the chief and right hand of Yuri. Prompt, energetic
and resolute, he loved to be in the front rank of every battle, and on a mighty horse
to tear through the heart of the enemy. He was greatly distinguished in war, excelling
in management, in the knowledge of details, and in the power of going at once to the
very root of a question. No matter what he undertook, he always proved himself a master.
</p>
<p>In 1169 Andrei, becoming greatly dissatisfied with Mystislav’s management in Kief,
formed a coalition of eleven princes, and marched with a large force against him.
After three days Kief was taken by assault; during three more days the place was pillaged,
the victors, in the frenzy of triumph, forgetting that they were Russians and that
Kief was a Russian city. Everything of value, including the contents of churches,
was carried away.
</p>
<p>Through continual civil wars, and the increased power of wandering hordes, a condition
of any permanency had become impossible, and the interest which Yuri took in Kief
was not shared by Andrei. Yuri had founded Suzdal, but, notwithstanding that fact,
he had spent most of his life in an effort to become Grand Prince of Kief. <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>Upon the decline of Kief, Suzdal, in the basin of the Volga, became the chief city,
but loving neither Suzdal nor Rostoff, Andrei determined to make Vladimir the capital
of Russia. The majesty of buildings had always attracted him, and he now invited from
every part of Russia, not only skilled workers in stone and in wood, but clever craftsmen
of all kinds. In Bogolyuboff he established many artificers; a whole ward was occupied
by masters in silver and gold work, and makers of holy images. He brought in not only
Russian artists, but artists from other lands, from Tsargrad and Italy. The chroniclers
of those days were astonished at the great number of these persons.
</p>
<p>Andrei spared neither treasure nor labor in ornamenting Vladimir. Remembering his
ancestor, who had adorned Kief with the Golden Gate and the Tithe Church, he determined
that his birthplace should equal Kief, the mother of Russian cities, hence he built
the Assumption Cathedral, which was esteemed at that time a marvel, and during centuries
it served in the North as a model for similar structures. The Assumption Cathedral
in Moscow, once the place for crowning the Tsars of Russia, and where the Emperors
are now crowned, was built on this model. He erected the Golden, as well as the Silver
Gate, called thus because the church dome at one gate was of gold, while at the other
it was of silver.
</p>
<p>The city of Vladimir, adorned with beautiful buildings, and exalted by the presence
of the marvelous image, became Andrei’s residence, and, because of the image and the
residence, also the capital city. In spite of the opposition of boyars in Rostoff
and Suzdal, the Assumption Cathedral of Vladimir became the main sanctuary of the
Russian land, and gave primacy to the city. The North was no longer the land of Rostoff
and Suzdal, it was mentioned more and more frequently as Vladimir. This Vladimir country
included what are known now as the governments of Vladimir, Kostroma, Yaroslavl, Moscow,
Ryazan, Tuer, Nizni-Novgorod, Bailozero, in other words what is really Great Russia.
</p>
<p>From time immemorial, in Russia the only place held in high honor was a place with
a sanctuary. The people revered Kief, because the Christian faith had first been accepted
there. In Kief there were relics and holy places and there also was the monastery
in which the great monks Antonio and Fedosia had lived. Till <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>Andrei’s day, the immense northern land beyond the forest contained nothing sacred.
Now two images, one made by Luke the Evangelist, and known as the Vladimir Mother
of God, the other that of the Holy Virgin as she made herself manifest to Andrei in
a vision, made Vladimir the first sanctuary in Russia.
</p>
<p>Popular belief assigned the founding of the city to St. Vladimir the Apostle and Grand
Prince. He had, in fact, come from Kief with the first metropolitan to baptize the
pagan people of that region, but the city was founded only during the days when Vladimir
Monomach was the ruler. It occupied, however, the spot on which the Apostolic Vladimir
had camped, on his way to baptize the people of Rostoff and Suzdal, hence it was said
that the city received its name from Vladimir the Apostle, the Purifier. Political
power helped the religious idea, and religion gave strength to the policy.
</p>
<p>In the mind of Yuri Dolgoruki the plan had been fixed firmly that his northern lands
must remain undivided. One reason why he had struggled for Kief so persistently was
to satisfy some of his sons in the South, while the North was to remain intact, and
be given to his eldest son. Through increase of Vladimir’s descendants, and the separation
of property, princes who had little land and no power became numerous. In extreme
cases Yuri had divided out towns of Rostoff and Suzdal for the temporary use of those
princes. Andrei’s brothers were not treated differently from others.
</p>
<p>Having fixed himself at Vladimir as the one power, Andrei would not give any brother,
or even any son, a bit of land in that region. His brothers and some of his nephews
worked with him, but all did what he commanded; they were simply his agents, doing
as he directed. And for them, he was the same lord precisely that he was for others.
Of course the boyars signified less than the princes, whether the boyars were his
own near advisers, or of the “ancient strong, local people,” “proud and powerful high
persons,” as men called them. These boyars had been met by his father and conquered.
They might have thought of struggling with Yuri Dolgoruki, but not with Andrei. Yuri
had battled with one and another of them. When defeated some had fled to neighboring
princes, others had been exiled, or imprisoned. But in Andrei’s time it might be said
with truth that every question as to the strength of the prince or the boyars was
settled.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>With those who opposed him, Andrei showed still less ceremony than had his father.
He spared not his brothers, in the least degree. Those of the “ancient strong people”
in Rostoff and in Suzdal who preferred the new order rallied round Andrei, and gave
him full support. There were others, and those were in the majority, who warred against
him in secret. For the time they threw out merely words like the following: “Rostoff
is old, and a great place, and so is Suzdal; Vladimir is only an adjunct.” But these
people knew that they were powerless against a prince who had the common men, the
land-tillers and craftsmen in full force behind him. Because of this relation of common
men to Andrei, and the hostility of most of the boyars and the wielders of weapons
who had lost places, there rose reports and explanations quite opposite, the substance
of which was expressed by the phrase: “There is a fierce battle in Rostoff and Suzdal.”
This was uttered by “proud high people,” and by men thrown out of office. Common men
used other phrases: “We love Prince Andrei. We love this grandson of Monomach. This
prince never rests from his labor, he keeps his mind and conscience clear. He has
love for God and man. He is firm and kind. He is good to the weak and to the ailing.”
</p>
<p>Andrei’s wars were waged always to benefit Vladimir and the people. He had no thought
for petty quarrels among princes, and never took part in them. A prince in his place
needed no special army. Towns and cities in that region were numerous, and ever prompt
to send warriors in defense of their interests. Whenever an enemy came, all people
were ready to rise. Instead of a chosen legion, led by boyars, who, in the old time,
surrounded the prince and curbed freedom immensely, Andrei received into his “courtyard”
whomever he wished, people of all sorts, and even all origins. They were not called
as in the old days drujina (friends), but dvoryani (court men). They lived in his
court and around it in complete acquiescence; they were people of his court. Though
the former name of drujina was not abandoned immediately, it lost its old meaning,
and soon the prince’s assistants were known as dvoryani, a word translated later as
noble. This word, used afterward to denote specially the highest people of Moscow,
had its origin in the Vladimir of Andrei.
</p>
<p>The wars carried on by Andrei had a definite policy. If he gave aid to some prince
who annoyed him by imploring, this aid was <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>limited to sending a small detachment. But he defended those who asked assistance
against enemies more by a threat than by fighting. If he warred, as happened later,
he did so in the interest of his own principality. His problem was to manage freely
in Kief and in Novgorod for the benefit of Vladimir. When one or another prince asked
his permission to reign in Kief, the mother city, that prince had to take an oath
not to meddle with Novgorod. Andrei did not care about Kief, but between Novgorod
and Vladimir there were endless dissensions, which rose from the fact that Vladimir
and Novgorod were neighbors. Novgorod, rich in commerce, was poor in land, and had
to get wheat and rye from Vladimir or regions beyond it. “Vladimir and Novgorod stood
face to face as opponents.” And besides the question of grain on one side and of trade
on the other was that of the boundless North with its treasures. Novgorod claimed
that northern region, claimed all of it. Wherever a foot of land presented itself
Novgorod wanted that to be the land of a man in its service. This proud understanding
of things was expressed by the phrase: “Who can stand against God and Lord Novgorod?”
But into those northern places had entered Rostoff and Suzdal, and now they were dealing
with Andrei of Vladimir.
</p>
<p>From times before Rurik, Novgorod men had the wish for dominion, but they could not
have this unless they could find a man to keep order, and be at the same time their
servant. That was why they had summoned Rurik. The Novgorod men had explored the great
North and East, and knew that its size was enormous. They counted as theirs that northeastern
region, but there was one corner, White Lake, which Vladimir could claim. Of this
corner Novgorod might not say beyond doubt: “It is mine,” still the city laid claim
to it. In Yuri’s day, Daniel the Hermit was sent by him to take possession of a point
north of White Lake, which place lapped over the Novgorod boundary, and caused endless
quarrels. But the real origin of the dispute was the water connection between the
Neva and the Volga—the so-called Dvina tribute. This was the source of the continual
dissension between Novgorod and Vladimir. Of this tribute and other questions we shall
hear later.
</p>
<p>Andrei made a campaign to Bulgar, a town on the Volga. Possessing already the upper
course of that river, he must have <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>command of its lower course, at least to the point where the Kama falls into it. Somewhat
lower than the entrance of the Kama, which finds its source in the great Ural Mountains,
was the city Bulgar. This time Andrei led the army in person. Under him were Ryazan
princes. He took the Vladimir Mother of God to arouse the courage and strength of
the army. The confidence which this holy image gave to the warriors passed every description.
When the Vladimir men entered the country of “unbelievers” the clergy went in front
of them bearing the image, and while preparing for battle, they turned to the “Commanderess”
with prayers for her blessing.
</p>
<p>The Bulgar campaign gave a great victory. Andrei’s forces captured all that they met
in that country and seized Bryahimoff, the chief town. Wherever the enemy appeared,
they were scattered. Vast booty was seized, and many lands were annexed to Vladimir.
The chief encounter took place August 1st, a day famed in the Russian calendar till
then as the day of the Maccabees, but thence forward changed to the day of the Merciful
Saviour. Andrei, seeing in this victory special favor, conveyed news of it speedily
to Manuel, the Greek Emperor. In Tsargrad, on that very day, they were celebrating
a victory over Saracens in Asia. On comparing dates it was found that the victory
in Asia and that on the Volga coincided. Hence the Orthodox Church in both lands determined
that the day should be called ever after the day of the Merciful Saviour.
</p>
<p>Andrei’s friendship in Tsargrad was great both with Emperor and Patriarch, and he
hoped that this friendship might aid him in giving Vladimir the first place in Russia.
He had resolved to raise it, not merely above northern cities, but above Kief, the
old capital. The problem was difficult, but he must attempt it. In church matters
Vladimir was still under Kief, whose metropolitan had power in all Russia. Vladimir
had its bishop, but he lived in Rostoff, a rival city. Now that Andrei had built the
great golden-domed church, and had subdued Volga regions, he intended to make his
Vladimir the capital of Russia in every sense,—not merely independent as to Kief,—but
superior, and resolved that the metropolitan of all Russia should reside there.
</p>
<p>Andrei summoned princes, boyars and people to Vladimir, and said to them: “This city
was founded by Saint Vladimir, <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>the Grand Prince who enlightened all Russia by baptism. I, though unworthy and sinful,
have by God’s aid exalted the Christian faith and extended it. I have adorned the
church of the glorious and holy Mother. I have given lands to it, and one tenth of
my income, I wish Vladimir to be the capital, the head of all cities in Russia.” No
man said a word to oppose this.
</p>
<p>Russian princes in regard to some things communicated with the Patriarch in Tsargrad
directly; on occasions they sent presents, and at times they sent envoys, but when
church affairs were discussed they were forced to act through the Kief metropolitan.
</p>
<p>Andrei sent a special envoy in this case, whose name, Yakov Stanishavitch, is preserved
to us. The prince explained in a letter that Vladimir was at the head of a new, immense
country where the Christian faith, unknown till recently, had become firmly fixed
and widely extended. Vladimir needed more strength and order in church service; she
prayed to receive a metropolitan. Boundless regions were now in light, regions which,
till his father’s day and his own, had been in darkness. His recent victories had
opened up new and vast countries. Andrei spoke a greater truth than he himself realized.
He had in fact opened up a new world in such form and meaning as no man at that time
comprehended.
</p>
<p>The boyars gazed with dread on him. Well might they ask: “How far will his plans go?
Does he think to enforce them on all Russia? Will he not take power from us, and every
significance? If he makes Vladimir the great mother city, where shall we find a place
in it?”
</p>
<p>In due time came the answer to Andrei’s letter. The Patriarch praised the zeal of
the prince in planting truth in new places, approved of his bringing order to lands
hitherto without it, but while revering that for which Andrei was toiling so earnestly,
his Humility the Patriarch could not grant the prayer of Prince Andrei, because the
Kief metropolitan already had jurisdiction in those northern lands. If the prince
had won new lands, in regions apart and divided geographically, the question would
have been different, but the regions under discussion could not be taken from their
present right relations without violating ancient rules and destroying Christian truth
as existent. Andrei had asked in the name of religion and truth, concealing his chief,
if not his only object. The Patriarch answered in the same way,—the <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>inevitable and ever recurrent method of masking the main point. Andrei was obliged
to abandon the project.
</p>
<p>During his father’s life, Andrei had married the daughter of Kutchka, a boyar who
had been put to death by Yuri. In family life Andrei knew little, if any happiness.
All his children died earlier than he, except one, the youngest son, Yuri, who married
Queen Tamara of Georgia and died in the Trans-Caucasus, prematurely, after painful
adventures. Neither from his wife nor her relatives had Andrei witnessed good-feeling.
No matter how he strove to draw near the Kutchkas, no matter what he spent in lavish
kindness toward them and their friends, they ever cherished for him a hatred which
nothing could extinguish. The same might be said of the men near Andrei. He had removed
his drujina and the boyars, and chosen new people. He treated those people with such
kindness and so liberally that he might hope to see them grateful. “Father,” “Giver
of good,” “Bestower of pleasant things,” “Nourisher” were the only words which they
might with honesty have said of him. These were the terms used in satire by those
men who witnessed but did not receive this attention. It was with the following words
that all described Andrei,—all save the circle which opposed him. “The beloved father,
the nourisher of orphans, kind and gentle, simple and strong, putting his arms round
the poor, loving those who are abandoned, giving them to eat and drink, like his great
ancestor Monomach.” He was holy also, though men did not know it. He had commanded
that at any time of the day or night, if there were a really needy man or woman, that
man or woman should be nourished. He had also built houses where the sick and the
unprotected might be received and cared for.
</p>
<p>From his youth Andrei, with all the kindness ascribed to him by the people, had not
many friends, because he was abrupt in manner, and as he grew older this abruptness
became more apparent. The expulsion of boyars and men who had been connected with
his father caused great discontent, and now his one prop was the people, who, though
with him to a man, were not in physical touch with him. He had incensed the princes
because he commanded at all points in Russia as he did in his own house. There were
reasons enough why princes and boyars desired the death of Andrei. Much was said about
<span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>defense against such a man. Reports were even current that Glaib of Ryazan and his
boyars were plotting against him, and that Rostoff and Suzdal boyars had joined with
Glaib. While men might expect action from this point, Andrei fell a victim to what
seemed a conspiracy of his servants and relatives. In any case he died at the hands
of his servants, brought to the deed, it may be, by keen machinations of princes and
boyars. That princes and boyars were the movers, and the others only the instruments,
there is, however, no formal proof. The story of the crime is as follows:
</p>
<p>The whole number of assassins was twenty. Four men were the leaders in the murder,—Takin,
whose personality is uncertain; Pyotr, son-in-law of one of the Kutchkas, Anval the
key-bearer, at that time a great favorite, and Yevfrem Moiseitch, a converted Jew.
A report was spread, on Friday, June 28th, 1174, that Andrei intended to summon and
execute one of the Kutchkas. That same day the four men made this decision: “To-night,
when Andrei lies down to sleep, we will kill him.” In the darkness between Friday
the 28th and Saturday the 29th the key-bearer, Anval, stole from Andrei’s chamber
the sword of Prince Boris, which had been an heirloom in Vladimir Monomach’s family.
On the afternoon of that day, Andrei’s wife had gone on a visit. In the evening Andrei
lay down to sleep without anxiety or suspicion. On the floor in the room lay one of
the little serving boys called “Bones,”—thus are they termed in the chronicles. The
murderers were completely armed. They came to the house, but when at the entrance
fear seized them and they ran out again. To get courage they went to find drink. After
they had drunk sufficiently, they returned and groped their way in the darkness. Having
found the door of the chamber where Andrei was sleeping, one of them tapped at it
lightly. “Who is there?” called the prince. The man who had knocked answered: “Prokofi.”
The assassins heard the prince say: “That is not the voice of Prokofi.” Hearing this,
they burst the door in with one effort. Andrei, suspecting the deed, sprang up and
grasped for his sword; the sword was not there. The two men who entered first Andrei
put down quickly. There being no light in the chamber, the assassins struck at random
and hit their own men till they found Andrei. He, being strong, fought in the darkness
a long time. The battle was <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>stubborn, but since twenty men were fighting with one, they at last overpowered him.
The victim groaned as he said: “God will take vengeance on you for my bread, which
you have eaten.” They hastened to finish. The breath seemed to halt in Andrei as if
the soul were going out of him, and he lay on his back in agony. They gave him, as
they thought, final blows, and waited in the darkness, till every sound ceased in
his body, and they found no trace of breath in him. Then, taking with them a man whom
Andrei had killed in the struggle, they started to grope their way out, but they could
not go quickly, for in fear and in darkness the right passage was missed. Halting
a moment, they discovered it, and going down the stone stairs to the open, again visited
the mead cellar. Coming back, they stood a while to recover from the inner air, and
from terror of the deed just accomplished.
</p>
<p>While this was taking place Prince Andrei, who had been left for dead, regained consciousness.
He sat up and remembered with difficulty what had happened; then, leaving the room,
he began to descend the stone stairway slowly, but as he went he betrayed himself.
He might have escaped had he gone down in silence, but he could not suppress groans
of anguish. The assassins heard those groans. “He is not killed!” whispered one in
alarm. They returned to the chamber hurriedly; Andrei was not there. “Where is he?”
asked one of another. “Quick! quick! we must find him!” They struck a light and, through
blood which had dropped from the wounds of the prince as he passed down the stairway,
they discovered him. Andrei, who saw the men coming, rose and stood behind a stone
pillar near the entrance to his palace, and when they saw him, he cried: “O God, receive
Thou my spirit!” Those were Andrei’s last words, He struggled no longer in mind, but
still he raised his hand and they cut off his arm at the shoulder. Thus died Andrei,
son of Yuri Dolgoruki, slain in his own house, by men whom he had treated justly and
with kindness.
</p>
<p>The next work of the murderers was to kill Prokofi, the favorite of the prince, and
their opponent. After the death of Prokofi they began to pillage. Before daylight
they had emptied the palace, the cellars, the places where holy images were made,
and the workshops where cloth of gold and of silver was woven and where precious stones
were set. Everything had vanished, gold, silver, silk, satin, rich furs, weapons,
and rare objects which Andrei <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>had possessed in abundance. At daybreak Bogolyuboff was as empty “as a hollow, old
tree.” The assassins were gone, each stolen thing had been secreted. To remove those
things quickly they had taken all the horses, even those used in the personal service
of the prince. They now sent men to Vladimir to declare what had taken place. “Have
no feeling against us,” said they to the people. “The thing done has happened in spite
of us.” “We know not who were with you,” replied the Vladimir men, “but whoever they
were, they will answer for this vile murder.”
</p>
<p>In Vladimir the boyars feared the morrow, and with reason, for common men loved Andrei.
And now came the clashing of forces. Men who had land and lived from it through the
labor of others had been opposed to Andrei, but those who themselves tilled land had
been on his side. These two groups stood face to face now like two armies. What was
to be done? Among boyars and the powerful at this time of peril, there was no confidence
in their own leaders. If there had been a leader in whom they could have trusted,
they would surely have conquered, but that man was lacking. The leader of the people
had been Andrei; now he was gone, and both sides were helpless.
</p>
<p>At first there was utter discouragement in Vladimir, a paralysis of mind for the moment.
Meanwhile no one knew where the body of Andrei was; no one knew what the murderers
had done with it till Kuzma, a former servant of the dead prince, discovered it. This
faithful man, who feared only God and loved no man on earth save Andrei, did not cease
his questions: “Where is the prince? Where is his body?” “We threw it into the garden,”
replied one of the assassins at last, with great insolence. “But go not near. We threw
out the body that the dogs might devour it. If thou go near, men will kill thee.”
</p>
<p>The old servant said nothing, but sought for the body and found it. “O thou my master
and friend!” cried he, weeping. “Didst thou not feel the approach of those murderers,
thou who didst terrify thousands so many times?” As he was weeping he turned, and
through an opening saw the eyes of the key-bearer, Anval. “O thou enemy, why art thou
looking?” called he then. “Give me some garment to cover my lord’s body, O thou heretic!”
“Be off!” called out Anval; “dogs will eat up that body.” “Give this body to dogs!
Remember, O reprobate, in what <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>clothes thou didst come to Prince Andrei; now thou art in velvet and cloth with gold
threads in it, while thy lord is lying dead here, and naked. Even such as thou art,
throw out to me something to cover my master.”
</p>
<p>Anval threw out an upper garment and a piece of carpet. Kuzma covered the body, wrapped
it in the carpet and carried it on his shoulders to the church, but no one would open
the door to him. “Do not come with him here,” said they. At that moment all near were
either on the side of Andrei’s enemies or in dread of them. Kuzma put down the body
before the door and cried, stooping over it: “Thou my master, thou, O strong prince,
thy lowest servants do not regard thee. Thou, O my master, who didst conquer the Balgars,
and gain immense countries, art not admitted to the church which was built by thee.
We are here at the door of it, I living and thou dead, and no one will admit us.”
</p>
<p>The body lay there two days, wrapped in the carpet and guarded continually by Kuzma.
In Vladimir the people were waiting in dread of the future. Those were two evil days,
opened by murder and robbery in Bogolyuboff, and succeeded by violence from Andrei’s
enemies. Every treasure was carried off, all that their hands could lay hold of. If
any servant was faithful, he was slain without mercy. In neighboring villages they
killed those who held office from Andrei, or were known to be friends of his. They
raised riots to excite evil passions and help men to forget themselves. But many of
those who committed such deeds were afraid, and with reason, that punishment would
strike them from Vladimir.
</p>
<p>That which failed the Vladimir men, namely courage, and which had to come, if it came,
from some other source, came from the clergy, and began in the Golden-domed Church
of Vladimir. The chief priest there was Mikulets, that same priest who in Vyshgorod
had care of the holy image, and later assisted in bringing it to Vladimir. After consulting
with other priests, Mikulets, arrayed in his robes, bore the sacred image of the Mother
of God through the city. A procession followed him. The conspirators were dumb and
complete quiet reigned in Vladimir. The people recovered their minds at once, and
all joined the clergy, who had great power, for the common people were with them.
After that men talked on the street and in other places about the need of burying
Prince Andrei with honor, of bringing his body from <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>Bogolyuboff and placing it in the Golden-domed Church which he had erected. The moment
that this was decided upon, the citizens formed a guard for protection. Seeing this,
the conspirators lost all courage.
</p>
<p>In Bogolyuboff also the clergy now showed the bravery and the decision necessary to
meet the blind insolence of those insurgent and riotous boyars, who thought that because
they had had the upper hand for a moment they would have it forever. On the third
day Arsenie, an abbot, took action. “Is our prince,” said he, “to lie before the church
door unconsidered, guarded by Kuzma? Open the door, and I will chant the sacred words
over the body. I will place it in the coffin myself, if no man will help me. God will
then have mercy and make an end of this disorder. Men will come from Vladimir to bear
hence the coffin with reverence.” Andrei’s body was put in a coffin, and placed in
front of the altar, and all the people of the city wept and sang in the sacred service.
</p>
<p>On the sixth day the men of Vladimir asked of the clergy a burial the most imposing
and majestic that could be given. It was arranged that the clergy of Bogolyuboff,
in complete church array, with crosses and emblems, were to follow behind the coffin,
and with them Kuzma, the old servant who had sat two days and nights before the church
door, guarding the body of his master. The clergy of Vladimir were to meet them between
the two places.
</p>
<p>When the Vladimir people met the procession, they were shown the highest honor. The
Bogolyuboff men, ready to receive them, stood around the coffin, and those who had
been appointed to take the coffin received it and moved on toward the city with awe,
and with great weeping. The road was thronged with a multitude of persons, filled
with reverence. All came forward to make the sign of the cross and look at the coffin
as it was borne toward its resting-place. No man could restrain his tears, as he wailed,
“O our friend, art thou gone from us, thou who built the Golden-domed Church of the
Holy Mother? Art thou gone from us?”
</p>
<p>Every man held it his duty to make the sign of the cross and repeat a prayer for the
soul of Andrei. Day and night continued those prayers, which people thought it a privilege
to say over the body of their prince, and the prayers offered by the Vladimir people,
and by a multitude of pilgrims from all parts of that northern region in behalf of
the victim, continued to increase for a long time. <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>From that day to this the people who wish to pray for Andrei are not decreasing in
number. To our time, in the chief church of Vladimir on the right side, as one enters
the northern door, stands the coffin of Andrei, and near it on the wall is his portrait.
Six miles from Vladimir is a single church, which marks the site of Bogolyuboff. There
also stands a part of the stone building in which Andrei lived, some of the walls
with their heavy arches, and the stone column behind which the prince stood when his
murderers gave him the last blow.
</p>
<p>A gloomy tradition is preserved among the people, touching the assassins and their
punishment. The Kutchkas and Anval were hanged, and fifteen men were decapitated.
Andrei’s princess, who it was thought had had knowledge of the plot, was sewed up
alive in a canvas bag and put into a basket holding stones sufficient to sink it.
That done, a cloth was wrapped around the basket and this cloth sewed together securely.
The basket was then thrown into the lake, and it vanished immediately.
</p>
<p>The following legend has immortalized the history of Andrei’s death. Near Vladimir
is a dark, swampy lake. In that weird lake is a spot which the people call “Floating
Island.” On that island are seen dark patches, which move hither and thither when
the wind blows. Every anniversary of Andrei Bogolyuboff’s murder, noises like groans
are said to come forth from the depths of that lake, now known as Foul Water—into
this foul water the basket containing Andrei’s false princess was thrown, and into
it were hurled also the murderers’ bodies.
</p>
<p>Of Andrei there remains in the minds of the Russian people a bright and pure memory.
From every part of Russia come pilgrims to Vladimir to pray before his coffin. With
the blood of a martyr, the prince sprinkled the house in which he lived. In the moments
of his bitterest agony he parted from this world with the words, “O God, receive Thou
my spirit,” and to that coffin people turn now, saying: “Pray thou for us also, that
the Lord may assist us against enemies.”
</p>
<p>Immediately after the death of Andrei, men of the party opposed to him in Suzdal and
Rostoff began to ask: “What are we to do, now that our prince is gone? With whom can
we replace him? Ryazan is our neighbor; if Ryazan princes attack, what shall we do
without a leader? Shall we not take a Ryazan prince? <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>The wife of their ruling prince is a daughter of Rostislav, son of Yuri Dolgoruki;
she is a relative of our late prince. Let us find a prince in Ryazan; that is better.”
The boyars sent confidants to Vladimir, who declared to the friends of Andrei: “Ye
are not many in number; ye would better not oppose Rostoff and Suzdal; your city is
still a dependency. It is wise for you to agree with us. If ye hold to the plans of
Andrei, we will meet you with war to the death. The Ryazan princes may also attack
you.”
</p>
<p>Volunteers from Rostoff and Suzdal hovered round, as it were, to support all these
statements. In Vladimir the “smallest people,” as they called themselves, and those
who were not in the boyar conspiracy, gave answer in this form: “Whose is with you,
is not on our side.” The boyars wanted a prince who would not punish those who had
caused the murder of Andrei. They wanted a prince who would be an opponent of all
that Andrei had established, hence they selected two nephews of Andrei, two orphans,
sons of Rostislav, Andrei’s elder brother, who died early.
</p>
<p>In Ryazan itself, where the conspiracy had originated, there was joy, but words were
few: no discussion was needed; all knew exactly what they wanted. In Rostoff and Suzdal
the plan existed even before Andrei was assassinated. Glaib of Ryazan, when envoys
came to him to ask for a prince in place of Andrei, was greatly delighted. To those
envoys he added others, and all went to Chernigoff, where the orphans were living.
</p>
<p>When the envoys appeared before Sviatoslav, he saw at once the meaning of the embassy
and was not pleased with the project of choosing the orphans. He insisted that Mihalko
and Vsevolod, brothers of Andrei, who were in Chernigoff, should go to Vladimir in
company with Mystislav and Yaropolk (the orphans).
</p>
<p>On hearing of this, the Rostoff and Suzdal boyars were angry, and sent a message saying
that Mihalko and Vsevolod were not to come nearer than Moscow. Mihalko paid no attention
to the message, but hastened to Vladimir, where the people received him with gladness,
and prepared for a siege by the boyars. Meanwhile Glaib of Ryazan, bringing Rostoff
and Suzdal forces, with Mystislav and Yaropolk, attacked the city. A siege of seven
weeks brought the people to famine and a surrender on promise that no harm should
meet any man. Mihalko and Vsevolod went back to Chernigoff, and the new princes, after
hearing the statement <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>of the Vladimir men: “Not against you have we struggled, but against the boyars of
Rostoff, who boasted: we will scorch you, and then send a posadnik to rule. Ye are
our slaves, O ye masons and carpenters,” took oath to give kindness and peace to the
people.
</p>
<p>But their position was impossible. The boyars, who had insulted Vladimir and forced
those two princes upon the country, were the real masters. Their friend, Glaib of
Ryazan, did what seemed good to him; his troops sacked villages in every direction
and burned them. Rostoff boyars got what they wanted; they and their friends took
all the offices of value. The importance of Vladimir was leaving it daily. The cathedral
was plundered, the holy images taken, and the chief one, that of the Mother of God,
was given to Glaib. He got also the sword of Boris, inherited from Monomach, as well
as silver and gems from the churches. He got much for he had helped much, and might
help still more in the future. Soon the position became unendurable. The plan of the
boyars was evident. They were undoing the work of Andrei, reducing and robbing Vladimir,
and enslaving common people. Seeing this clearly, the Vladimir men were enraged to
the utmost, and sent at once for Mihalko and Vsevolod. The brothers set out from Chernigoff
immediately, but at the <span class="corr" id="xd32e1295" title="Source: Oka">Oká</span> Mihalko fell ill and was carried on a litter to Moscow, where envoys from Vladimir
were waiting.
</p>
<p>The boyars prepared now for a life and death struggle. Yaropolk was sent with forces
toward Moscow to cut off Andrei’s brothers from Vladimir. But they were well on their
way, and Yaropolk missed them in the deep forests of that time. On learning this,
he sent a swift courier with warning to Mystislav, who hastened at once to cut off
Mihalko and Vsevolod. He met them near Vladimir, and rushed at them “as if to devour
them,” says the chronicler. But as his chief forces were militia without marks to
distinguish them from other men, they became mixed and confused with the men of Vladimir,
and had to cease fighting. That at least was the tale told when they were reproached
by the boyars. The truth was, as it seems, that the common men of Rostoff and Suzdal
would not fight against those of Vladimir, and whatever struggle there was, was sustained
by the personal following of the boyars.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mihalko and Vsevolod, in after years called “Big Nest” because of his many children,
were installed June 15, 1176, a great and memorable day for Vladimir. The people praised
the Lord and His Holy Mother for their ready assistance. “Oh,” said they, of the Ryazan
and Suzdal boyars, “they did not care for God’s truth; they boasted that they would
do what they liked with us. Well, God did not let them offend us.” The defeated princes
vanished; Mystislav fled to Novgorod, and Yaropolk sought refuge in Ryazan.
</p>
<p>The new princes gave peace to the whole country promptly, and then, resolved to settle
with the faith-breaking Glaib of Ryazan, they marched against him that summer. Their
success had thus far been so signal that Glaib was alarmed and sent envoys with this
message: “I bow down to you; I am to blame in every way. All that was seized by Mystislav
and Yaropolk and given to me, I will gladly return.” He sent back the treasures with
the holy image, and the sword of Boris that Andrei had kept in his bed-chamber. Peace
was made, and the princes returned to Vladimir.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Peace in Vladimir was short-lived, however. Mihalko died that year, 1176. The men
of Vladimir acknowledged Vsevolod and kissed the cross to him, as did all the Suzdal
men then in Vladimir. The popular voice was in favor of Vsevolod, but the boyars of
Rostoff insisted that in the oath given to the late prince no mention had been made
of his brother, hence no man was bound to consider him as heir of Mihalko, and this
occupation of the throne was illegal. “Come to us quickly!” said the boyars, in a
message to Mystislav. “We will have none but thee to rule over us.”
</p>
<p>Vsevolod marched now with his forces toward Suzdal, but the people were not altogether
satisfied with him; they complained of his kindness, and his self-effacing politeness
to rebels. He had sent to Mystislav, his nephew, saying: “Vladimir and Pereyaslavl
have kissed the cross to me; they are mine. Rostoff has sent for thee. Let it be so;
stay thou in Rostoff. Let Suzdal wait; whomever Suzdal chooses will be prince there.”
Mystislav was not opposed to this offer, but the boyars who had sent for him would
not consider it and said: “If thou think to be reconciled with thy uncle, we will
not permit thee.”
</p>
<p>Mystislav now invaded Vladimir, and from Yurieff sent his uncle a message, which was
something between a demand and a request to visit him for a personal conference. Vsevolod
seemed ready to go, but when his partisans heard of the matter their anger was very
great. “Think not,” cried they, “to visit the camp of the enemy. Those people are
seeking thy life; they are oath-breakers, all of them. Are we to perish because thou
art soft-hearted?”
</p>
<p>So Vsevolod refused the request and a fierce battled ensued with Mystislav, his nephew,
near Yurieff. The boyars of Rostoff and <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>their followers fought with great valor. The men of Vladimir, “the masons and carpenters,”
needed no urging to pay back the insults which they had received, and strike down
the men who had tried to enslave them. The battle hung long in even balance, till
the Pereyaslavl men “tore forward with all their strength,” and pushed back the right
wing of Mystislav’s forces; at this juncture the Vladimir men, aided by a regiment
from Suzdal, swept everything before them. Mystislav fled from the field with few
followers; not many of his adherents could save themselves. His two main advisers,
Dobrynya Dalgi and Ivanko Stefanovitch, fell in the battle. The surviving boyars were
seized and bound with ropes. Mystislav made his way to Novgorod, but Novgorod men
conducted him out of the city with these words: “God has given judgment against thee,
in the dispute between thee and thy uncle.”
</p>
<p>He went then to Glaib of Ryazan for assistance. Glaib gave fresh aid to his brother-in-law,
and they raided Vladimir territory at once, plundering and burning all before them.
At last they burned Moscow. This action forced Vsevolod to leave Rostoff regions,
and make ready to attack Glaib’s inheritance. But Glaib marched home quickly from
Moscow, and Vsevolod deferred the attack till his forces were properly assembled.
Novgorod of its own will had offered volunteers. From Chernigoff were coming Oleg
and Vladimir, sons of Sviatoslav, with good warriors. From southern Pereyaslavl on
the Alta were coming men under Vladimir, Vsevolod’s nephew. Vsevolod set out for Ryazan
toward the beginning of winter, but on the way halted at Kolomna, where he received
most astonishing intelligence,—intelligence which turned his campaign in another direction.
</p>
<p>Glaib with his two sons, and with Mystislav, who led a large force of Polovtsi, had
gone by other roads to Vladimir, the capital. The Polovtsi were plundering, burning,
and taking captives; Glaib had given them a free hand on every side. He himself had
seized Bogolyuboff, had torn down the chief doors of its church and stripped the place
of everything.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod, moving with swift marches toward his capital, found the invaders in a strong
camp near the Koloksha, a river flowing into the Klyasma, some miles from Vladimir.
The Polovtsi had their thousands of prisoners in stockaded pens, while Glaib’s booty-laden
<span class="pageNum" id="pb113">[<a href="#pb113">113</a>]</span>wagons were arranged in a place at that time inaccessible. Both he and the Polovtsi
were beyond the river. Winter was beginning, but the season was capricious beyond
parallel. Frosts, thaws, rains, followed one another unexpectedly, and made the passage
of the river dangerous and exceedingly difficult, hence the two armies stood a whole
month there facing each other. Glaib wished for peace, but Vsevolod would not grant
it. Glaib had not been offended by Vsevolod. He had listened to evil tales from Rostoff
men and from Mystislav; he had brought in the Polovtsi; he had plundered the churches
and pillaged Vladimir; his punishment must meet him.
</p>
<p>Vladimir of Pereyaslavl on the Alta at last led troops across the river, and took
a flank position against Mystislav, Glaib’s ally. After this, reinforcements crossed
over in numbers to strengthen him, Vsevolod remaining meanwhile on the other bank
of the river: Glaib, thinking to cut Vsevolod off and capture him, pushed across the
river. While he was making this movement, Vladimir struck with great impetus on Mystislav,
put his warriors to flight and pursued them. Glaib’s men crossed the river, but seeing
their comrades in flight on the other side, fell into disorder. Vsevolod charged now
quickly, and a general rout was the end of the battle. Oleg and Vladimir, sons of
Sviatoslav, rushed forward to hunt down the Polovtsi. Their warriors were trained
well in sword-play, and they spared no man. Of the Polovtsi only those who were swiftest
and strongest could save themselves. Joyous shouts were raised in the pens which the
pagans had built around their captives, freed now by that fortunate battle. Mystislav
was made prisoner. Nearly all his advisers were slain; those who survived were bound
with hemp ropes and taken to Vladimir.
</p>
<p>The return of the victors to the capital was a triumph such as no man there had ever
seen or imagined. In front of all rode the princes, Oleg and Vladimir, who had hewn
down the Polovtsi; next came the bound prisoners, the boyars, then Vsevolod the conqueror,
and last of all came the captives saved from the Polovtsi by the battle. Delight was
unbounded in Vladimir, where there were mothers who had been weeping for sons, and
wives for husbands whom they had looked on as lost to this world. To crown the whole
victory were the treasures and booty seized from the Polovtsi.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>After the triumph came questions of policy, and here the prince and the people differed
greatly. “He is too kind,” said the people. “He does not understand those traitors,
their plans and their wickedness. He is too innocent, too good-hearted.” Still Vsevolod’s
celebrated “good-heartedness” was what bound the people to him. They believed him
to be honest and kind. But they saw in the captured boyars vile enemies with whom
there could be no compromise. They were traitors who had burned, robbed and slain,
and were not to be forgiven. They accused the Ryazan princes and boyars openly of
framing the plot to kill Andrei. They accused Glaib’s brother-in-law and his adherents
of being connected with the murder, because they exhibited no enmity toward the assassins.
</p>
<p>All the inhabitants met and took counsel. Then, going to Vsevolod, they addressed
him thus: “We are willing to lay down our lives for thee, and will spare nothing.
But those Ryazan prisoners are treated as if they were guests in our city. In secret
they are preparing to attack us, and will do so if freed from prison. We ask thee
to punish these enemies with death, or if not with death to put their eyes out. If
thou wilt do neither, deliver them to us. We will care for them.”
</p>
<p>It was difficult for Vsevolod to restrain the people who stood there before him. He
promised to keep the prisoners, not as guests, but in strictness, and to treat future
captives more sternly. He declared also that he had sent a demand to deliver other
enemies to Vladimir; if not, he would march to Ryazan with his warriors. But prayers
for the captives came now from many sides. Mystislav the Brave, who had married Glaib’s
daughter, begged Sviatoslav of Chernigoff to free the prisoners if possible. A whole
embassy came from Chernigoff with the bishop at the head of it. In Vladimir the report
spread that Vsevolod was weakening. There was anger a second time, and more danger
than ever. The people threatened to break open the prisons and slay the captives,
or at least blind them. The crowd gathered in greater numbers than before. Vsevolod
went out to them, accompanied by the bishop, and declared that the Ryazan princes
would not be freed until all the conditions were complied with. The bishop spoke to
the people, who answered: “We wish not to break faith, we ask only that God’s justice
be dealt out to traitors. The Lord himself, <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>seeing their wickedness, has delivered them to us. Are we free to liberate such criminals?”
</p>
<p>Seeing this intense feeling, Vsevolod gave his final decision: “Yaropolk and Mystislav
will be freed only when blinded. If Glaib yields not the cities which we demand of
him, he will stay in prison till he dies there.” On hearing this the people went to
their homes somewhat pacified. Toward evening of that day the sons of Rostislav suffered
that operation which gave them the name of Bezoki, or The Eyeless ever after. The
“Good-hearted,” however, had given command not to injure their eyes, but to simply
perform an operation which would deceive the people. The executioner made deep cuts
above their eyes, which he seemed then to dig out. In the night both princes were
borne away to Smolensk very speedily, lest the people should kill them even though
they had been blinded, as was supposed. Years after, the story was current that they
had been blinded through too great anger of the people, and that the Lord had given
back to them their eyesight. Still, though they had their eyes, they retained the
surname—Bezoki.
</p>
<p>Freedom was offered Glaib if he would yield up Kolomna. He did not accept the proposal.
To the offer made through the Prince of Chernigoff that he should go to the south
and surrender the Ryazan principality, he gave the stern answer: “Rather than do that,
I will die here in prison.” Some time later, while still a prisoner, he was found
dead. After Glaib’s death his son, Roman, having promised perfect submission, was
set free with permission to go to Ryazan.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the war and the disturbance which broke out after the murder of Andrei,
and lasted from 1174 till 1177. It ended to the profit of the work begun by Yuri Dolgoruki,
enlarged by Andrei, and strengthened by Vsevolod.
</p>
<p>The work of Yuri, his father, and Andrei, his elder brother, was completed finally
by Vsevolod. During his life Rostoff and Suzdal, and now we must call it the Vladimir
country, contained a well-ordered society, in which the prince’s authority was great,
because the people approved and accepted it. The people and the prince stood face
to face squarely. The people knew well that their popular society could not stand
without the prince, and the prince knew that he could not rule a day without the people
to support him. This mutual understanding secured the position of Vladimir <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>and made Northern Russia what it is to-day, the head of a great empire, and, after
Northern Russia, made what is called Great Russia, that country beyond the forest.
This land of the younger sons of Monomach grew to be more important than the domains
of the eldest sons, and got the upper hand of Southern Russia.
</p>
<p>Rostoff and Suzdal bowed at last, when forced to do so, and Vladimir became, as to
influence, the mother of Russian cities, the recognized capital. This was the result
of the understanding between prince and people, and of that searching for the best
place wherein to do a work,—an effort which is always made when people are in earnest.
Later on, Vladimir lost the position and Moscow attained it. But at first Vladimir
was the natural capital of Russia. It was the place in which the greatest number of
people were willing to give their adherence to him whom they considered best qualified
to hold their society together. And in that age the prince by descent and connection
with their history was the man for that work. Because of this great mutual interest,
the people and their prince formed a unit, while the boyars formed a number of units,
each acting mainly for itself.
</p>
<p>Among the princes who preceded and followed him, Vsevolod occupied an exceptional
position. He seemed not to strive for mastery. He made no claim to be Grand Prince
of all Russia, or even of Vladimir. But when all Russia was mentioned, it meant in
the minds of most people that Russia which had its head in Vladimir. In this way,
though Vsevolod was not called Grand Prince of all Russia, he was treated as holding
that position, and the political business of Russia was carried on in great part in
Vladimir.
</p>
<p>After the death of Sviatoslav of Chernigoff, “the sister’s son,” Kief had no great
significance. During the life of this Sviatoslav, it might have been said that the
Russia of Kief and that of Vladimir balanced each other, but in different senses.
After Sviatoslav’s death, Vladimir was beyond question the capital of Russia. Galitch
fell a victim to the struggles between boyars. Rent by internal dissensions, it became
a prey at times to Volynia, at times to Smolensk and Chernigoff, and was torn apart
finally by Poles and Hungarians, to the first of whom it at last became a possession.
</p>
<p>Toward the end of his reign, Vsevolod felt able to treat Kief more decisively. While
his friend Sviatoslav was living, the Prince <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>of Vladimir held aloof from the South, but when “the sister’s son” died, Vsevolod’s
activity so increased that South and North became closely connected. Through nearness
to Ryazan and to Novgorod, Vsevolod had to deal with them always, and his dealings
with these two regions were more important than those of any prince who preceded him.
</p>
<p>The Ryazan princes, conquered in that war after which Glaib died in prison, had engaged
to appear before Vsevolod whenever he summoned them. Kolomna had been joined to Vladimir.
The same fate awaited Ryazan, in case of refusal to carry out promises. Its princes
had increased greatly in number, and to them were added those of Pronsk and Murom.
But no matter how those princes united and fought, they could not resist Vladimir.
In case of resistance, they knew not how to deal with the problem. Behind them were
small quarreling parties, in front a united strong people. The Ryazan princes were
under guidance, and this meant what it means always, subjection. Vsevolod, through
kindness, but also through wisdom, would not claim to be master.
</p>
<p>As to “Great Lord Novgorod,” it was surrounded by adherents of Vsevolod. Not at that
moment, but soon afterward, the city preferred a bad peace to good warfare. The Dvina
land dropped away from Great Novgorod, and from giving tribute to that city, and joined
Vladimir. After that, smaller places about which there might be disputes crept away
gradually and became connected inseparably with the capital. Novgorod could not go
anywhere, to the harm of Vladimir. The Volga was closed to the city completely, nothing
that touched the Volga was accessible to Novgorod without the consent of Vladimir.
Vsevolod strengthened the town at that point where the Oká joins the Volga, and called
it Lower Novgorod (Nizni-Novgorod). Soon he settled people there, and so roused that
region that during the time of his children Lower Novgorod became a considerable city.
In the days of his grandchildren, the settlement which extended from the city became
a large district, and to one of those grandchildren it went as a portion.
</p>
<p>On the Volga, at its upper waters, Tver was now founded at the side of the Tvertsa
River. To this well-fortified little town came settlers in such numbers that, even
in Vsevolod’s day, it became the head of a principality. The Vladimir men not only
defended <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>this place from “Lord Novgorod,” but they made it a new advance post against that
proud city. They seized also Nova-Torg, the portage.
</p>
<p>The Vladimir princes held now an exceptional position toward Novgorod. If they could
retain the two places Torjok and Tver, they were superior to Novgorod, in every case
equal. In Yuri Dolgoruki’s day, Novgorod men, keen to spy out advantage, were watching
for eastern connections, and would have seized the Vladimir position and prevented
the rise of a principality, had not Yuri anticipated them. Yuri’s work, done in the
nick of time, settled the fate of “Lord Novgorod.”
</p>
<p>It was only when firmly seated on the throne of Vladimir that Vsevolod found himself
at enmity with the men of Novgorod, whom he could not forgive for receiving the Bezoki
(Eyeless) with great kindness, and for having seated Mystislav, one of those brothers,
in Novgorod, and the other, Yaropolk, in Nova-Torg. Mystislav died somewhat later,
and they buried him in Saint Sophia, the Novgorod cathedral. They transferred Yaropolk
then to their own city.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod seized at once every Novgorod merchant in the land of Vladimir. He stopped
commerce between the two cities, and began war in earnest. This alarmed the Novgorod
men greatly, and they showed Yaropolk the road leading out of their city. Though Vsevolod
himself was satisfied with the banishment of Yaropolk, and was ready to raise his
blockade, the war was continued by the people, the reason being that Vladimir and
Tver men thought that it touched not only the honor of their prince, but still more
their own profit. They wished to stop the encroachments of Lord Novgorod. Again they
blamed Vsevolod for good nature; again they accused him of indecision. “The Novgorod
men,” said they, “take oaths every day, but they break them continually. We are not
here to kiss Novgorod warriors, but to stop their advance.” They took Nova-Torg then,
bound every man in it capable of fighting, seized women and children, took all goods,
burned the place, and sent the captives, tied with ropes, to Vladimir.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod moved now toward Nova-Torg, but before reaching the town, he decided that
enough had been done to punish Novgorod, hence he retired to Vladimir. Soon after
this the Novgorod <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>people invited Mystislav the Brave, son of Rostislav, the Smolensk prince, to rule
in Novgorod. Mystislav the Great was revered beyond all princes who had ever ruled,
and Mystislav the Brave was his grandson. The young prince’s heart did not lean toward
the city, however, and the more he thought over the matter, the more he resolved on
refusal. But his brothers and his drujina began to urge him, and at last he yielded
to their persuasion and went to Novgorod, where he was received by a procession and
with great honor. He visited Holy Sophia and then sat on the throne of his father
and his grandfather.
</p>
<p>The service Novgorod men prized most in their princes was the defense of the city
against pagans,—the Chud, who swept in from the side of the Baltic. Pskoff and Novgorod
borders suffered greatly at first from wild men, who had an unknown, boundless country
behind them. These men had at last been defeated and tribute imposed on them. Among
the tributes established was the bearing of goods and boats over portages. All at
once, just before Mystislav’s coming, these men sent to bear goods became robbers.
When the prince assumed power, he called together the best men of Novgorod, and said:
“Brothers, let us free this Novgorod land of offenders.” With one voice they answered:
“If it please God and thee, we are ready.”
</p>
<p>When the troops were assembled, and Mystislav drew them up in review, he found that
they numbered twenty thousand. He went to the land of the pagans, and these twenty
thousand men marched with him. He passed through that land from end to end, not stopping
till he reached the seacoast. He seized men, cattle and property; when there was need
to punish, he reduced all before him to ashes. In one word, he established obedience.
Then he turned toward Pskoff.
</p>
<p>According to old usage, the posadnik of Pskoff was appointed by Novgorod, but on this
point there were endless disputes between the two cities. The Pskoff men wished independence
and their own prince. During the winter of 1180 Mystislav planned a campaign for the
springtime. He remembered the offenses of Prince Vseslav, the Plotsk wizard, who could
turn, as the people declared, into a gray wolf and run in one night from the Caucasus
to Novgorod. Vseslav, years before, had seized a part of Great Novgorod; he had carried
off its assembly bell and borne away holy images and <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>church vessels. Mystislav resolved to bring all these back to the city. The prince
in Polotsk at that time was Vseslav, a brother-in-law of Roman, son of Rostislav.
</p>
<p>When spring came, Mystislav moved against Polotsk with his army. Roman sent an envoy
to meet him with these words: “Thou hast not been offended by Vseslav, why go against
him? If thou decide on attack, thou wilt meet me before others.” Mystislav, not wishing
to offend his own elder brother, turned back from his enterprise. Barely had he reached
Great Novgorod, when he fell ill. No man could tell what affected him. For a time
he lay without memory. His wife stood at his bedside, as did his drujina and best
friends. When his mind returned, he looked at those present, and tears came to his
eyes. Only a few of the words which he uttered had meaning. Vladimir, his youngest
son, he entrusted to a favorite boyar. Of the two sons left to his brothers, one was
renowned much in later years as Mystislav the Gallant. “Forget not my children,” begged
he of his brothers. He raised his hands, sighed from the depth of his heart, tears
came to his eyes again, and his breath left him.
</p>
<p>Roman, eldest son of Glaib, and once prisoner in Vladimir, had married a daughter
of Sviatoslav, the Kief prince, and had thus become an ally of “the sister’s son.”
In 1180 Roman’s brothers turned to Vsevolod of Vladimir, saying: “Thou art our lord
and father; settle between us and Roman, who takes away our land at the advice of
his brother-in-law, Sviatoslav.” Vsevolod moved against Roman, who met him at Kolomna.
Sviatoslav sent his son Glaib from Kief to aid Roman. Vsevolod invited this son of
Sviatoslav to meet him and negotiate. Glaib was unwilling to do so, but as Kolomna
was occupied by Vsevolod, he had to accept the inevitable. Upon his arrival, Vsevolod
ordered him put in chains and sent him to Vladimir, whither he sent all the men and
property seized by Glaib’s warriors, commanding that both man and property should
be kept under strong guard. Roman, leaving his two younger brothers in Ryazan to defend
it, fled to steppe regions. When Vsevolod marched to Ryazan, the princes submitted,
whereupon he made peace and apportioned the principality between them. All kissed
the cross to Vsevolod, even Roman, who returned now and joined his brothers.
</p>
<p>When he heard that his son had been captured, Sviatoslav was <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>tremendously indignant, and went at once to Chernigoff. In Chernigoff, at that time,
ruled Yaroslav, brother of the Kief prince. Of the younger princes, there were present
in the city Igor, son of Sviatoslav, and his brother, Vsevolod the “Rushing Bull,”
as he is called by a Russian poet. With them were their sons just reaching maturity.
All had taken to heart the offense which Sviatoslav had suffered. After they had counseled
together and were agreed, Sviatoslav addressed them in these words: “As a father,
I command you to act as follows: thou, Igor, will stay with Yaroslav, my brother,
to guard Chernigoff, while I will go to Suzdal to free my son from Vsevolod. And let
God judge between us.”
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav left one half of his forces in Chernigoff, and led away the other half,
taking with him a man who was his guest at that time, Yaropolk Bezoki. Sviatoslav’s
son, Vladimir, who had become prince in Novgorod after the death of Mystislav, was
to meet his father on the road. The allies from North and South assembled in lands
within the Tver boundaries, and marched toward Pereyaslavl.
</p>
<p>Beginning at the <span class="corr" id="xd32e1377" title="Source: Tversta">Tvertsa</span> and on the Dubna, they laid everything in ashes, sparing nothing. “They emptied the
whole Volga region,” says the chronicler. When forty versts from Pereyaslavl, they
met Vsevolod on the Blena River, a branch of the Dubna. The Vladimir prince was in
a wonderful position. The Blena had steep, rough, stony banks, broken into gullies.
The place was chosen wisely, for it was remarkably defensive. The warriors had their
positions on heights and in hollows. No enemy could reach them. During two weeks the
armies faced each other. Vsevolod’s army was numerous, and, if compared with the forces
of Sviatoslav, was enormous. As the Ryazan and Murom princes had to ride with their
men at the stirrup of Vsevolod, they were now in his army. Against Vsevolod were the
sons of the Kief prince, Oleg and Vladimir, the latter now Prince of Novgorod. These
were the two princes who a short time before had conducted Vsevolod to Vladimir, and
had cut down the Polovtsi in battling with Ryazan, which was now on the side of Vladimir.
The personal following of the Vladimir prince was eager to engage the enemy; his warriors
were praying to begin the battle, but Vsevolod would not permit them to advance. At
first he sent out the warriors <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>of Ryazan and Murom, who burst into Sviatoslav’s camp and broke the regiments of Chernigoff,
but “Rushing Bull” came to the rescue and drove back the assailants with much loss.
After that, nothing was won on either side; every effort was fruitless. Sviatoslav
tried now to negotiate, and, through two priests who had come with him, sent this
message to Vsevolod: “My brother and my son, I have done thee much good and did not
think to receive such a return from thee. Thou hast imprisoned my son, and harmed
me greatly. Give now a road by which I can go to thee. If not, I will give thee a
road to meet me, and let God judge between us.”
</p>
<p>Vsevolod sent the two priests as prisoners to Vladimir, and gave no answer to Sviatoslav,
whose position then was not free of danger. Delay was impossible; Sviatoslav saw that
warm weather was coming, that rivers would rise, and all roads would be impassable,
that, in fact, if he did not withdraw he would be forced to surrender, hence he raised
camp and departed. Vsevolod gave his men leave to attack Sviatoslav’s train, but forbade
them to injure the Kief prince, or pursue him. Sviatoslav’s allies, avoiding places
which they had plundered in coming, burned many towns, among others Dmitroff, the
town in which Vsevolod was born. Sviatoslav permitted his son Oleg to withdraw, and
also Rushing Bull, his cousin, and with Vladimir, another son, went to Novgorod, taking
with him Yaropolk Besoki, and seating him in Nova-Torg.
</p>
<p>In the South, after Sviatoslav had gone on this expedition against Vsevolod, Rurik,
son of Rostislav, prepared again to seize Kief. He brought from Volynia Vsevolod,
and also asked aid of Yaroslav “Eight Minds,” who sent a few men under Tudor, his
boyar. David, Rurik’s brother, set out for Smolensk to get help from Roman, but Roman
died before he arrived there. David then seized the vacant throne, and delayed in
Smolensk. Yaroslav, who with Igor, his cousin, was left to take care of Chernigoff,
did not wait for the enemy, but marched at once to strike Smolensk regions. With their
own men those two princes took also Polovtsi, and hastened toward Vitebsk. One of
the Polotsk princes, Glaib, had joined the Smolensk side, and, with the aid of Smolensk
warriors, was fighting against the other Polotsk princes, who were defending their
independence. They had brought in allies from Lithuania, and timely assistance came
now from <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>Chernigoff. Because of this, the war assumed large proportions at once. The Chernigoff
princes sent to Novgorod, then acting with Sviatoslav of Kief, and expected help from
that city. In the camp of the Polotsk and Chernigoff allies appeared—a thing till
then never witnessed—aid from Lithuania and Livona. And now was understood what “strength
from the Baltic” meant.
</p>
<p>Against this combination stood David, the new Smolensk prince. He had wished to force
the battle, but Yaroslav of Chernigoff held back; he was waiting for his brother.
Yaroslav occupied a strong position near the Drutcha River, and remained a whole week,
warding off the enemy, who could only reach him by crossing the river. Sviatoslav
of Kief now appeared, and began at once to bridge the Drutcha. David, seeing the strength
of the enemy, would not risk a battle, and withdrew to Smolensk very promptly. Sviatoslav
burned the Drutcha fortress, ended the expedition, and returned to his capital. Yaroslav
and his cousin, Igor, went to Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>Vsevolod of Vladimir, incensed at this Novgorod and Ryazan struggle, attacked Nova-Torg,
stormed and captured the town, seized Yaropolk Bezoki, and carried him to Vladimir.
Novgorod, grown weary of wrangling, dismissed Vladimir, son of Sviatoslav, and requested
Vsevolod to send the prince whom he liked best. He sent one of the most obscure princes
of that period, his own brother-in-law, however. Satisfied with the change in Novgorod,
Vsevolod now liberated Glaib, and all were in agreement again.
</p>
<p>The peace which followed was strengthened by two marriages. A son of Sviatoslav of
Kief, that Glaib just released from prison, married Rurik’s daughter, and Mystislav,
another son, married a sister-in-law of Vsevolod. So there was harmony between North
and South for a season. Sviatoslav not only made peace with the Prince of Vladimir,
but sent two sons to assist him in his campaign against the Silver Bulgars. “God grant
us in my day to stand against pagans,” wrote Sviatoslav, and he sent one thousand
men, led by Vladimir, his son, late prince in Novgorod. Forces came, too, from Ryazan
and Murom, also from Pereyaslavl in the South, that place which the Polovtsi had always
hit the hardest. This contingent was led by Izyaslav, the most gallant of Vsevolod’s
nephews. All the forces met at Nizni-Novgorod, whence one <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>part of the army advanced on horseback, and the other in boats down the Volga. Vsevolod
himself was with the expedition.
</p>
<p>Never before did Russians go into an enemy’s country so deeply as this time. They
gave many a defeat to the pagan Bohmitan, as Mohammedans were called at that period.
But in front of a palisaded fort, to the great grief of all, the gallant Izyaslav,
son of Glaib, was struck in the heart by an arrow, and brought to the Russian camp
dying. The loss of this youth, loved by the army, was avenged through a crushing battle
fought at the edge of the Volga. More than one thousand Bulgars were drowned with
their boats. More than fifteen hundred were cut down near the river. The body of the
brave Izyaslav was taken back to Vladimir, and buried there with great honor.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince did not wish at that time to bring Mohammedans under his rule; his
only desire was to prove beyond question that Nizni-Novgorod and the places around
it belonged to Vladimir, his capital. He wished to settle Russian ownership in those
places, and establish moral influence over the people who lived between him and the
Mohammedans, and who were still pagans.
</p>
<p>Not fearing war when it must come, but shunning it always when possible, Vsevolod,
at home again, toiled at developing the lands of Vladimir. He desired, above all,
the confidence of the people, and won it through giving them safety, order, and prosperity.
He was busied specially with the many towns founded by Yuri, his father. In Suzdal
he built a strong fortress, and put walls around it. He also repaired the cathedral
in that city. “Though old, let it be as if new,” was said of the building. Pereyaslavl,
renewed, and adorned as in the old time, grew distinguished.
</p>
<p>In Vladimir the Kremlin was enlarged with walls and towers of greater beauty and strength
than even those of Suzdal. In other towns also did Vsevolod labor and erect buildings
which were monuments. But the chief one, the marvel of Vsevolod’s day, and the one
which, after centuries, forms in our time the glory of Vladimir, is the cathedral,
which he built in honor of Dmitri, the martyr of Salonica. Not equal in size and in
wealth to the church which Andrei built, it surpassed that golden-domed structure
in proportions and beauty. It was noted, moreover, for a subtle variety of exterior
adornment. But the God-loving church builder enriched it with relics more precious
by far to believers than silver <span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>or gold. Those treasures were a slab from the grave of Dmitri, his tunic, and some
of the great martyr’s bones. Unbounded delight was felt by the men of Vladimir when
those sacred relics were brought to the city.
</p>
<p>Ryazan was a source of great anxiety to Vsevolod, for its princes were always quarreling,
and they did not hesitate to openly threaten one another with destruction. The Grand
Prince was forced to put an end to these disputes. To guard his own cities he must
protect Ryazan regions from the Polovtsi. The insolence of those nomads increased
with the quarrels of the Ryazan princes. In view of this, Vsevolod undertook a campaign
against the Polovtsi, and went to the heart of the Don region. He struck at the center
of the steppes occupied by the “wild” Polovtsi, those who made the Ryazan attacks.
He passed quickly and assailed their winter quarters, but his agile foes slipped away
at once; he merely frightened them. To defend Ryazan, it was necessary to have Ryazan
itself under control.
</p>
<p>At this period party struggles in Novgorod sometimes threatened the peace of Vladimir,
but Vsevolod had no need to support princes whom by request he had sent to that city.
He made no move to stop Novgorod from changing their prince. When the city complained
of Yaroslav, Vsevolod replaced him by Mystislav, son of David of Smolensk, his ally
in the Bulgar expedition. When Novgorod, which never liked any prince long, asked
for Yaroslav a second time, it got him. More than once did those two unimportant princes
rule Novgorod. Later on these words came from the city to Vsevolod: “Novgorod is the
inheritance of thy father and grandfather; send thy own son to us.”
</p>
<p>Vsevolod sent Sviatoslav, one of his younger sons, at that time a boy. Several times
this son was returned to his father, and sent back each time at request of the city.
Holding Novgorod in peace by commanding the roads to it, the Grand Prince was not
disquieted by that city, but Ryazan affairs were involved and troublesome.
</p>
<p>Roman, the eldest Ryazan prince, had brought his brothers to war with one another.
He was a vain and ambitious man who, as son-in-law of the Kief prince, thought far
more of himself than was proper. Igor and Vladimir, younger brothers of this Roman,
who with him held Ryazan, had invited Vsevolod and Sviatoslav, their brothers who
ruled in Pronsk, to visit them. Those younger <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>brothers, hearing that the other two wished to imprison or kill them, remained in
Pronsk and fortified the city. The elder brothers marched promptly against Pronsk,
besieged the place, and ravaged the country around it. Roman and his brothers, in
making this war, appeared to censure their younger brothers for good will toward the
Prince of Vladimir, and also to declare that they themselves cared not a whit for
that Vladimir principality. Thus their action was a challenge to Vsevolod, and he
gave answer very quickly. Without mingling in the quarrel between the brothers, he
sent two boyars to Ryazan with this message, which was really a warning: “It is not
a wonder to me that pagans ravage your country. But it is a wonder that ye, instead
of living like brothers and guarding your lands against Bulgars and Polovtsi, attack
one another and slay your own people. I will not permit such deeds. God has sent me
to preserve justice and protect people, to bring to obedience those who break the
law criminally. I fear that unless I am careful, God will judge me for the crimes
that ye are committing. O brothers, what harm are ye doing? I leave that for you to
judge.”
</p>
<p>Though the princes knew well what these words meant, they answered haughtily. Wise
and cool advisers were not numerous among them. “Each man of their intimates gave
nine powers to himself in comparison with others, and, seeing no enemy, was a victor
at all times.” They nourished the quarrelsome nature of Roman, and he answered the
envoys, with insolence: “What right has Vsevolod to talk here? Are we not just such
princes as he is?” The envoys brought back these words to Vladimir. The younger princes
in Pronsk had asked Vsevolod to help them. He, to show that he had been asked to protect
the weaker, and not as an exhibition of strength, sent three hundred men to aid Pronsk,
where they were received gladly. But Roman, with his brothers, continued the siege,
looking contemptuously on such a contingent. Vsevolod now sent against Roman the Murom
princes and a regiment of his own men. These troops were still in Kolomna when Roman,
alarmed at the approach of such forces, left Pronsk with his warriors and hurried
home. Vsevolod, one of the Pronsk princes, left Sviatoslav, his brother, in the city
and went himself to the allies in Kolomna. When informed of Roman’s flight, the contingent
considered the campaign at an end, and returned <span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>to Vladimir. But the Pronsk prince went to Vsevolod’s capital, and asked for further
protection, as he had no confidence in maintaining peace with his elder brothers.
</p>
<p>When Roman heard of the retreat from Kolomna of the allies, he returned and attacked
Pronsk a second time. Turning the river, he deprived the place of water and brought
the people to great suffering. Then he tried to capture Pronsk by treachery, and at
last succeeded in this way: Sviatoslav, who held the city, became an enemy of Vsevolod,
his brother, who had gone to Vladimir. “Destroy not thyself and thy men with hunger,”
said Roman to him. “Come out to us. Thou art our brother, why fear us? We are fighting
not against thee, but against the Prince of Vladimir.” The friends of the besieged
prince continually repeated to him words like these: “Thy brother Vsevolod has gone
over to the Prince of Vladimir; he has deserted and betrayed thee. Why destroy thyself
and us?” At last, influenced by these speeches, the Pronsk prince surrendered. The
three hundred men from Vladimir were captured and sent to Ryazan. A worse fate befell
the men serving the prince who had gone to Vladimir, and, as his enemies alleged,
had gone over to the Grand Prince. They were seized, every one of them, both boyars
and common men, bound with ropes and thrown into prison. Roman detained Vsevolod’s
wife and children, and imprisoned them. Vsevolod of Pronsk, on hearing of this, began
war against all of his brothers.
</p>
<p>When news was brought to the Prince of Vladimir that Pronsk had been captured by deceit,
he at once prepared for war in earnest. He began by sending a message to the prince
who had surrendered to Roman: “Give back my men. Give back all my men and property.
Thou and thy brother asked aid of me. Not wishing to desert you in trouble, I gave
it; now thou hast made peace with Roman and betrayed the men sent by me.” When the
Pronsk prince received this message, Roman, fearing an attack from Vladimir, sent
straightway these words to the Grand Prince: “Thou art our lord, father and elder
brother. Wherever there is an offense against thee, we will be first to avenge thee.
We have warred against our brother, for he would not obey us, but be not angry because
of that. We stand with bowed heads before thee. Thy men will be freed without harm,
and immediately.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Grand Prince, seeing that Roman had turned from venomous malice to deceitful submission,
did not wait for a lying peace. “An honorable war is better than a disgraceful peace,”
declared he to the envoys of Roman, and he sent them away. He moved then on Kolomna,
and commanded the Murom men and the Pronsk prince to advance. They crossed the Oká,
and on the Ryazan side made a desert wherever they showed themselves. Knowing the
state of affairs in Ryazan, the Polovtsi, who were ever watching with keenness, rose
and began to ravage the country. The lands of those wrangling brothers were subjected
to every evil that man could inflict. Roman, not forgetting that he was a son-in-law
of the Kief prince, and remembering that Ryazan was connected with Chernigoff territory
in some degree, begged the Chernigoff princes to bring Vsevolod to leniency. The bishop
of Chernigoff, who was the Ryazan bishop also, was sent to the city of Vladimir, where
he begged the resident bishop to assist him. The two bishops, aided by boyars from
the Kief prince, persuaded Vsevolod that peace was best if obtained with honor. The
trouble now lay in details. The real question which rose in the mind of Vsevolod was
this, that the Ryazan princes must cease to be sovereign, they must obey Vladimir.
The bishop assured him that the princes promised this faithfully, that they would
kiss the cross to be under his will altogether, and would in future obey him. The
Grand Prince granted power to make peace on this basis. That done, he liberated all
the Ryazan men held captive in Vladimir. He freed also the envoys, who had been sent
to him, and then appointed an embassy to conclude the treaty in Ryazan. The Chernigoff
bishop reached Ryazan earlier than Vsevolod’s envoys. He brought details of the conditions
proposed, and had influence on negotiations, but everything that he presented, and
that he did was in a different spirit from that concerted in Vladimir. Then he hastened
home to Chernigoff, avoiding the envoys of the Grand Prince. The Chernigoff bishop,
it is clear, desired that Ryazan should remain bound to Chernigoff in church matters,
and subjected, in some degree at least, to his own direction.
</p>
<p>To Vladimir it was very important that Ryazan should not be under Chernigoff in any
way. The Vladimir people blamed Porfiri, the Chernigoff bishop, for acting not as
a man of God, but as a wily politician. They complained that peace with Ryazan <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>was not concluded on the conditions fixed in Vladimir. They wished Vsevolod to expose
the man who had given information in a sense hostile to Vladimir, and then vanished.
But Vsevolod did not find it proper to do what they demanded. Peace was concluded,
and the princes, who had sworn to recognize Vsevolod of Vladimir “to the full extent
of his will,” were bound over now to submission. Vsevolod, Roman’s brother, was reinstated
in Pronsk, and he and his brother regained all the lands there, both ruling in common.
</p>
<p>After that the princes of Ryazan without exception remained obedient to Vladimir.
The troubles just described occurred in 1185–86, and so strong were the relations
formed then that years later, when Constantine, son of Vsevolod, was crowned in Vladimir,
all the Ryazan princes were present to render homage.
</p>
<p>In 1184, being again friendly with Rurik of Bailgorod, and David of Smolensk, as well
as with the Volynia princes and the Prince of Galitch, Sviatoslav of Kief invited
all princes to join him in a war against their common enemy, the Polovtsi. The southern
princes promised Sviatoslav aid, but in Chernigoff his brothers and cousins were more
difficult to deal with than remoter relatives, because of questions touching land
in Chernigoff. His sons needed territory in that region, and princes, when dividing
lands, nearly always disputed. Still his brothers and cousins did not refuse directly.
The campaign, they said, was arranged awkwardly for them. If he would change the plan
they would go with him. But other princes had assembled, and with them warriors in
sufficient number.
</p>
<p>With the Kief prince marched his sons, Glaib and Mystislav, also the gallant Vladimir,
son of Glaib, from Pereyaslavl on the Alta. From Volynia came Roman, son of Mystislav,
who brought with him two cousins, and also princes less distinguished. From Smolensk
came Izyaslav, son of David, and Rurik came from Bailgorod. Yaroslav Eight Minds sent
a contingent also. The allies, under Sviatoslav, came upon the enemy near a river,
now known as the Orel, but then called Erela by the Polovtsi, at a place where the
Vorskla and the Erela, both tributaries of the Dnieper, flowing almost parallel and
close to each other, form a long tongue of land bounded by the Dnieper and those two
rivers on two sides and one end. At that time this place was called simply “The Corner.”
In that corner was won a great victory.
</p>
<p>When they were nearing the Polovtsi, the daring Vladimir, son <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>of Glaib, therefore grandson of Sviatoslav, begged for the first place. “Let me go
against them, O my father,” implored he. “They have turned my lands into a desert.
Let me go in advance with my men to attack them.” But the sons of the prince would
not consent to be behind Vladimir in valor, hence Sviatoslav sent forward with his
gallant grandson all the youngest princes of his guard, adding twenty-one hundred
Cherkasi to strengthen their forces, but Vladimir led on with such swiftness that
the princes going with him were left far behind, and he with his single command met
the enemy in “The Corner.”
</p>
<p>The numerous vanguard of the Polovtsi swept round the advancing Vladimir and sent
word quickly to Kobyk, the chief Khan in command of the army, that they had the Russians
surrounded. The Polovtsi were delighted. “We have not worked for this,” said they,
“but the Russians have come to us. Great wealth is falling into our hands; we will
take it.” And they rushed with shrill, piercing shouts to the battle. Vladimir withstood
the fierce onset. The youngest of the princes held his ground; he did not quiver.
The Polovtsi, not dreaming of resistance such as that, were astounded and whirled
back on both sides to give a blow with more impetus. Meanwhile Kobyk, the commander,
moved out strong detachments. These rushed forward swiftly. The Khan, thinking that
there were no attackers save those who were fighting in front of him, commanded to
strike savagely, to break, and then to hunt down Vladimir’s detachment.
</p>
<p>But, all at once, the Polovtsi saw new forces hurrying forward. These were the princes
who had set out with Vladimir, but Kobyk mistook them for Sviatoslav and his whole
army. The Polovtsi, now greatly alarmed, wished to escape from the field, but that
second force held them at bay. A fierce battle raged, till at last the Polovtsi were
thrown into disorder. At that juncture, Sviatoslav and the older prince came up. The
victory was complete. Kobyk was captured, and with him his two sons; Toblie with his
son and also his brother. Of Khans alone twenty were captured, and common men were
taken in great numbers. Among Khans who fell, the chief one was Tarsuk. The battle
was on Monday, June 30, 1184. “God gave an immense victory over pagans, and Sviatoslav
returned to Kief with great glory and honor.”
</p>
<p>Igor, the Chernigoff prince, who had not gone with Sviatoslav <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>against the Polovtsi, had, besides land questions, many cares to detain him at home.
He was a son-in-law of Eight Minds. This old Galitch prince had long since divorced
his wife, a daughter of Yuri Dolgoruki, hence a sister of Vsevolod of Vladimir, with
whom she had taken refuge. Eight Minds had also expelled his legitimate son, Vladimir,
who for a time could find no asylum in any place. From Galitch he turned first to
Roman, son of Mystislav, in Volynia, but this stern prince had so much fear of old
Eight Minds that, for reasons of interest and policy, he would not let the exile pass
even one night in his capital. No matter where Vladimir tried, and he even went to
Vsevolod, his uncle in Vladimir, he found no reception till he turned at last to his
sister, and Igor, her husband, in Chernigoff. With them he found rest, for they met
him with kindness. He lived two years in Chernigoff,—lived there until he was reconciled
with his dying father, old Eight Minds.
</p>
<p>This connection of Igor with Galitch brought ruin later on to his sons, but who in
that day could foresee this? Just at the time of Vladimir’s visit, a wave of delight
was passing over Russia. Sviatoslav’s victory over the Polovtsi was magnified as the
“Erela triumph.” All men glorified this marvelous adventure. The Chernigoff princes
had taken no part in it, so now the thought dropped into Igor’s mind to win glory
in this very field, independently, and at all costs. He boasted of his own campaigns,
and said to his warriors: “Though the Polovtsi came to those princes and they fought
with them, they dared not follow them. But with you I will cross the Don and crush
them. If true success comes, we will pursue them to places to which our grandfathers
never thought, even in dreams, of advancing. We will win for ourselves splendid glory.”
</p>
<p>With his own men and a detachment of Chernigoff warriors, Igor set out on his adventure,
April 23, 1185, accompanied by his son, now touching manhood, his brother Vsevolod
the “Rushing Bull,” and a few neighboring princes with their forces. He met the Polovtsi
in a desperate battle, and was vanquished with great slaughter. He and his fellow
princes all went beyond the Don,—but they went as prisoners. “They were taken from
the saddles of princes and put on the saddles of captives.” Along the whole Luko Morye
(Sea of Azoff) shouts of delight rose from pagans. <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>At the place where the Don River touches the Sea of Azoff, thousands of Polovtsi were
singing and celebrating, not honor to Russia, but <span class="corr" id="xd32e1440" title="Source: woful">woeful</span> disaster. “Little Polovtsi boys and beautiful Polovtsi maidens magnified the fame
of their people.”
</p>
<p>This crushing defeat of Igor’s forces roused all the Polovtsi to greater activity,
and gave them at once boundless insolence. They sent a message to Sviatoslav: “Come
hither and ransom thy brothers, or wait at thy own place till we come for our people.”
By this they referred to Kobyk and the other Khans captured on the Erela. And now
the Polovtsi raced over Russia. They burned and plundered, and seized captives. The
gallant Vladimir, son of Glaib, defended himself at Pereyaslavl on the Alta. “Wounded
from head to foot,” he was borne out of battle dead, as his friends thought. A year
later he died of those wounds, though he had apparently recovered, and had warred
against the Polovtsi a second time. After Vladimir’s death there was no heir to Pereyaslavl
on the Alta, hence the place went to Vsevolod of Vladimir.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav’s grief was unspeakable when he heard what had happened to Igor and his
comrades. “Striplings!” said he, overwhelmed with sorrow and bitterly bewailing their
rash enterprise. “Why did they tarnish the glory of victory? Why did they ruin the
work of an old man and his allies? Why did they destroy a God-given triumph?” He had
walled up the road against pagans, and the “striplings” had thrown this wall down
again.
</p>
<p>All measures possible were taken by Sviatoslav to ward off the onrushing Polovtsi,
but these measures were inadequate and in no way proportionate to the strength of
the enemy. Igor was humble in presence of the misfortune which he had caused. He prayed
and did penance, often repeating: “Why have I remained alive; I, who have destroyed
so many people?”
</p>
<p>Not soon did those robber raids cease, but they did cease in time, not so much because
the Polovtsi had inflicted great and sufficient loss on the Russians as because that
flush of joy at a victory, which for them seemed well-nigh incredible, died away;
and then the two camps, one on the Kief-Chernigoff border, and the other on the Polovtsi
steppe, resumed their former attitude.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Igor lived in captivity among the Polovtsi, but without hardship. His servants were
left with him; he had his own equerry. He was even allowed to hunt. Men set to guard
his tent showed the prince honor. One of those guards, Lavor, grew to love Igor greatly,
and to serve him in Russia became finally his one thought, hence he planned an escape,
which succeeded. During night hours the guard over Igor was strict; for whole days,
and for weeks even, he was never from under the eye of some watcher. This was true
especially in the first days of his captivity. He was least under guard after sunset,
when, during supper, the Polovtsi drank their kumys and grew tipsy. On the night of
escape, Lavor was waiting with horses beyond the river. When darkness came down, Igor
rose in his tent, and after making the sign of the cross on himself with a small holy
image, hanging this image and a cross around his neck, he pulled aside the tent curtain,
stepped out and walked rapidly away to the river. The guards were drinking kumys,
and thought the prince safe in his tent. Igor waded through the water and found Lavor
on the other bank waiting with two horses.
</p>
<p>Great rejoicing spread through Russia when news came of Igor’s return. He went first
to Kief to visit Sviatoslav, and the aged prince, with tears of delight in his eyes,
embraced him.
</p>
<p>Igor’s young son, Vladimir, while in captivity with his father, fell in love with
the Khan’s daughter and married her. “The Khans have entangled him with a beautiful
girl,” was the saying, but he was ransomed and the marriage was celebrated with great
solemnity in Russia. As war with the Polovtsi did not prevent Russian princes from
being friendly and intermarrying, so also their connections did not prevent them from
warring, as the princes <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>who became related with the Polovtsi through marriage often warred with them afterward.
Hence Igor warred with the Polovtsi after this marriage, as well as before it.
</p>
<p>The raids of the Polovtsi and the campaigns of Russian princes against them were so
many that it would not be possible to describe them in detail. They were an incurable
evil in Russia, and continued to be so till the Mongol invasion and conquest put an
end to them.
</p>
<p>While Kief, the mother of Russian cities, was declining, Galitch was forming a separate
principality, and the influence of its western neighbors rose more and more. Hungarians
and Poles, who had joined Latinized nations, could boast at this time that they formed
in Eastern Europe the foremost advance of Latin influence, the remotest boundary of
the Holy Roman-German Empire, beyond which was Russia. In the life of Poles and Hungarians,
there were many traits in common. First came subjection of all the people by nobles,
while the sovereign merely focused the splendor of nobles and magnates. The sovereign
held office to preserve supreme privileges for nobles; beyond that he meant nothing
to them, and for the people he had no meaning whatever. From the nobles came the laws,
the disposition of wealth, the amount of taxation and its character. The income from
lands and towns, and all the government of the country was in possession of the upper
class solely, hence the amazing concentration of wealth in their hands. The nobles
did as they pleased, while the people endured all that was put on them. Hungarians
and Poles yielded themselves to the West in religion. Their learning was Western,
and, for the greater part also, their vices. They imparted these vices to their neighbors
of Galitch, where they found a place in the palace and brought about a great riot,
which ended in the burning alive of Anastasia, the mistress of Eight Minds, whose
legal wife had fled to seek an asylum with her brother Vsevolod, Prince of Vladimir,
at that time generally called Big Nest. Later on riots were frequent, and the power
of the boyars grew daily.
</p>
<p>In 1187, the famous Yaroslav Eight Minds, feeling that death was near him, summoned
his advisers and the clergy, and commanded them to open his palace to every one, to
rich and poor, great and small, to all people, and he bade farewell to every person,
saying: “Fathers, brothers, sons, forgive me as I go from this <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>world of vain effort. I have sinned more than any man. Another like me there has not
been. Fathers and brothers, forgive me.” He wept for three days. Three days did the
people come to see him from all sides. The dying man ordered his goods to be given
to the needy and to monasteries. “I did what I could,” said he, “to defend those who
were wronged, and to dispose taxes so that they should not be a burden to some beyond
others. I tried not to listen to informers, and to drive off the evil-minded; some
I exposed to the public, others I punished in private. I had many vices myself, I
could not control all of them. I beg now forgiveness of every one.” Many poor people
received gifts, and much wealth was distributed. “God sees,” continued Eight Minds,
“that I wished for the good, but through weakness I could not obtain it.”
</p>
<p>The intimate boyars and the older clergy surrounded the death-bed of Eight Minds;
others were in remoter chambers, and the people filled every entrance. He disposed
of the principality to his sons in this fashion: “To Oleg,” said he, “I bequeath Galitch;
to Vladimir, I give Peremysl,” and he commanded the people to take oath to the princes
in that sense. Oleg was the son of Anastasia, his mistress, and was dear to him.
</p>
<p>Soon after Eight Minds’ death came boundless confusion in Galitch. Among common people
intense hatred of Anastasia was general, and all the boyars detested Oleg, her son.
There was such a variety of factions that an armed outbreak seemed likely. Though
some had kissed the cross to Oleg, they favored Vladimir; others wished neither son
and were ready to call in Roman, son of Mystislav, Prince of Volynia. A third group
would hear nothing of either son, or of Roman, but declared openly for Hungary.
</p>
<p>The bond between Galitch and Hungary was ancient. Many of the boyars had friends and
even relatives in that country. They visited Hungary, for it was near, and they went
thither frequently on business, and sometimes lived in that domain. They liked the
Hungarian political order because the common people were submissive and looked on
the nobles as masters. The highest class was exceedingly haughty. It was sovereign,
and the king was its servant. The ties between the boyars of Galitch and Hungary became
so enduring and intimate that the heir to Galitch might find aid more readily in Hungary
than in Kief or Vladimir.
</p>
<p>Vladimir, son of Eight Minds, was by his first marriage a <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>son-in-law of the Kief prince. His wife, dead at this time, was a daughter of Sviatoslav,
“the sister’s son.” But that marriage had been so unfortunate that the father-in-law
did not like even to mention it. Roman, son of Mystislav of Volynia, was now intriguing
against Vladimir, though he had promised his daughter to Vladimir’s son. In Smolensk
the prince had just given refuge to the natural enemy of Vladimir, Rostislav, son
of Ivan Berladnik.
</p>
<p>After the burial of Eight Minds, the intrigues and the efforts of boyars led to nothing,
and Vladimir was raised to the throne by the wish of the people. Anastasia’s son,
the hated Oleg, had to flee from the country and, dying while young, vanished from
record. Vladimir inherited every vice of his father, but not one of his virtues. Disorderly
from boyhood, and unconnected at all times, he conducted one year and a half of his
reign most disgracefully. All people complained of him. If any man’s daughter or wife
pleased Vladimir, he took her. Then he married a woman of such sort that the people
of Galitch were indignant. As happened in the case of Anastasia, his unlegalized stepmother,
people never mentioned this new woman’s name, and would not speak in detail of her.
They only knew that from her the prince had two children. She had been seized from
her husband, a priest, and knowing this, no one cared to speak further. Among common
people she was mentioned as “the priestess.”
</p>
<p>The anger roused by this marriage was so great that it very nearly caused an uprising.
Vladimir’s son by his first wife was married to a daughter of Roman. She was in Galitch
at that time. Roman, the crafty Prince of Volynia, tempted the boyars of Galitch.
To win for himself the principality, he urged them against the unworthy Vladimir.
Common people were true to Vladimir, but the boyars sent these words to him: “The
people do not oppose thee, but they will not bow down to a priest’s wife. Take whatever
princess seems good to thee; they will receive any decent woman, but they will put
an end to the priest’s wife.” The boyars knew well that he would not part with the
“priestess,” and that both would leave Galitch if threatened. And thus it happened.
</p>
<p>Vladimir took treasures, and all the gold and silver which he could carry, and fled
to Hungary with his priestess and his children. The Galitch men made no move to stop
him. Roman came promptly and was made Prince of Galitch. He gave Volynia to <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>Vsevolod, his brother, and kissed the cross while bestowing it, but, as was shown
somewhat later, he was over hasty in this action.
</p>
<p>The King of Hungary, Bela&nbsp;III, gave Vladimir and his priestess a friendly reception,
and promised good aid to the fugitive. They agreed on all points as to what assistance
should be given, and then kissed the cross to each other. Soon after, at the head
of an army, large and famed for knightly character, Bela&nbsp;III set out to reinstate
Vladimir. Roman, though brave and resolute, on hearing of Bela’s approach, did not
venture an encounter. He saw clearly that though the men of Galitch were not fond
of Vladimir they were true to him, for he was their “native prince,” and they believed
that in a war he would undoubtedly have God’s justice on his side. They attributed
his flight to the treason of boyars. These same boyars were so hostile to one another
that a bloody conflict seemed impending. Roman’s adherents were few; they needed protection
against other boyars. A large majority of the boyars throughout the whole country
were opposed now to every prince, no matter who he might be, and they opposed more
than all the stern Roman, whom they dreaded greatly, not doubting that, were he sure
of his strength and position, he would strive to crush them. Many therefore declared
their adherence to Bela, who was then drawing near, and was already in the Carpathians.
</p>
<p>Roman took Vladimir’s property and all the treasure accessible. He gathered his adherents
of lower degree and his boyars, with their wives and children, and turned toward Volynia,
but Vsevolod would not vacate his capital, and did not admit his brother. Roman, deprived
of land, was obliged to seek the aid of friends. He had been married to a daughter
of Rurik of Smolensk, and now he sent his wife to her father; with her went the wives
of boyars, and their children. Rurik gave Roman temporary possession of Torchesk,
and then commanded Vsevolod to yield up Volynia to his brother and go back to Bailz,
his own portion. Vsevolod, fearing Rurik’s anger, obeyed without murmuring, and Roman
recovered the lands which he had given away too lightly.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Galitch, there happened a thing without parallel in Russia. King Bela
was met with such honor that he was astounded. The boyars went forth to him with a
solemn announcement of loyalty. The chief men among them declared that they <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>knew well his methods in Hungary, that to them the order there was very pleasing,
and they begged him to bring just such order into Galitch. Because of this surprising
statement, Bela dropped Vladimir and gave the management of Galitch to the boyars.
He installed his own son, Andrei, as chief of the government. Vladimir he took back
to Hungary as captive, on pretense that he had given a false and deceitful representation
of the troubles in Galitch, and besides had not paid the sums promised for friendly
assistance. The king took all Vladimir’s property, and put him and his “priestess”
under guard in the tower of a castle. It was made to appear that the people of Galitch
had bowed down to Bela, and had begged from him a government with his son as a ruler.
He had graciously yielded, and had not only given a son, but his heir to rule Galitch.
</p>
<p>To Bela&nbsp;III was now added the title Rex Galiciæ (King of Galicia). But as Hungary
was subject to Rome in religion, and the title of every dependent State was confirmed
by Papal blessing, the Pope of course reckoned the new kingdom among other bishoprics.
The boyars knew well that when the people of Galitch learned of this there would be
a great outburst, and a war against men of a foreign religion. Still the adherents
of Bela, those who had put the land under Latins, guaranteed that the people were
mild, and that the subjection of Galitch was a very slight matter, if the Latin faith
were brought in without vaunting, by degrees, and in a way not to be noted. The great
point was to respect ancient customs and venerated ritual.
</p>
<p>After Bela had made his son king in Galitch, he learned very soon that he had been
led into serious error. He had word from Andrei that the position was torturing, and
would soon grow impossible. Bela was in friendly relations with princes in Central
and Northern Russia. Sviatoslav, the Kief prince, negotiated with him continually.
He sought connections for his children, and for his grandchildren, and there are absolute
proofs that before Bela established his son in Galitch, negotiations directly concerning
that principality were carried on between him and the Kief prince.
</p>
<p>Andrei’s position in Galitch became at last unendurable. The adherents of Hungary,
supported by the capital and by the forces of Bela, seemed to triumph. The whole land
was seething, however. <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>The people were ready to rise, but knew not to whom they might turn for aid. Among
boyars there were a few who had not betrayed the people. Even among those who found
their support in foreign regiments, there were some who began to speak of preserving
their country and its customs. Listening to men who called for their own native princes,
a party of boyars withdrew from the traitors, and, kissing the cross, swore to stand
with the people. They then sent envoys to Smolensk, on behalf of all Galitch, and
invited Rostislav, son of Ivan Berladnik, to come and be their prince. Rostislav consented,
and was received with joy on the boundary, but he soon found that he would meet scant
support in the capital, where those boyars who favored Hungary still adhered firmly
to King Andrei. At this time Bela sent fresh troops to his son, and the Hungarian
commanders, on hearing of Rostislav’s coming, made all the people take oath a second
time. “Those who were loyal to Galitch kissed the cross without changing, while traitors
adhered still to Hungary.” Rostislav met the Hungarians advancing against him, and,
fearing betrayal, knew not what to do. The men who had invited him to Galitch, and
who surrounded him with followers, implored him to retreat for the present, but the
son, as ill-fated as his father, hesitated. “Brothers,” said he at last, “ye have
kissed the cross to me, and now if other men of Galitch wish my head, let God and
this cross be their judge. I will not wander over foreign earth longer, I will die
in the land of my inheritance.” And he rushed to the battle. He was wounded in the
onset and thrown from his horse. His men rescued him. Swords were sheathed on both
sides, and the wounded prince was taken to the city. The Hungarians, to avoid civil
war, thought it wise, as they said, to be rid of Rostislav, so, as if to heal his
wounds, they placed on them poisonous herbs, from the effects of which he died soon
afterward and was numbered with his ancestors.
</p>
<p>Andrei, who had been assured that no one wished a Russian prince, came now to see
realities. The Hungarians fell to wreaking vengeance on the people. The Latins ridiculed
the Greco-Russian faith; they turned Russian churches into stables; they contemned
the clergy; they brought their horses into the houses of those boyars who had fled
from Galitch, or did not hide their opposition to Hungary. An unrestrained orgy began.
Violence increased <span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>in every place. Hungarians took wives and daughters from the men of Galitch with growing
frequency. Wails of anguish and despair were heard throughout the principality and
finally they reached all parts of Russia.
</p>
<p>In Kief, the clergy turned to Sviatoslav and Rurik. “Strange men have taken your inheritance,”
exclaimed the metropolitan. “Ye should vie one with another in freeing Galitch from
this misery.” But those princes cared little for anything in Galitch, or elsewhere,
unless it gave power or profit. Moreover a quarrel broke out between them.
</p>
<p>It transpired that Bela, negotiating in secret with Sviatoslav, had worked out for
himself many useful conditions. He now proposed to go from Galitch, and begged Sviatoslav
to send some son of his to end negotiations. So Glaib was sent. But Rurik stood against
this embassy and reproached Sviatoslav, saying: “Since thou hast sent thy son to Bela,
and said no word to me touching the affair, our treaty is broken.” A dispute rose
which came near ending in bloodshed. The Kief prince, striving to soften Rurik’s anger,
returned this answer: “My friend and brother, I sent my son, not to rouse Hungary
against thee, but on my own business. If it is thy wish to march against Galitch,
I am ready. I go with thee.”
</p>
<p>The princes met in peace and planned an expedition. Rurik marched with his brothers,
and Sviatoslav with his sons, but the Kief prince had his own plan in mind, hidden
carefully. Kief was surrounded with the possessions of Monomach’s descendants,—Vyshgorod,
Bailgorod, and almost all lands on the Ros belonged to them. Sviatoslav hoped to add
these regions to Kief, and give Galitch in exchange for them, which he was ready to
yield altogether to Rurik. He did not speak of this to Rurik when they were planning
the march on Galitch, but only while marching. It turned out that Rurik was not anxious
for unreliable possessions in Galitch, and preferred greatly his own lands within
the Kief region. This caused a quarrel. No matter how much both princes talked upon
the subject, they reached no agreement. When half the journey was finished, they turned
and marched back to Kief. The fate of Galitch was settled by other adventurers.
</p>
<p>Vladimir, confined in the tower with his priestess, grew weary. Bela had taken all
the property brought by Vladimir to Hungary, <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>but the captive had coin sufficient to bribe the guards watching him. Among those
guards were some so devoted to Vladimir that they undertook, not merely to let him
escape, but to conduct him through pathless forests to Germany. The first question,
however, was to get out of the tower. In this work the hitherto shiftless Vladimir
proved abler than many a wise man. The tower was high and the prisoners were kept
in the top of it, where there was a small outside platform. On this platform was a
tent, made of canvas, in which a man might find shelter from heat in the day-time,
and gaze at the stars during night hours. Vladimir tore this tent into strips with
which he made a long rope and slipped to the earth by it. The trusty guards took him
to Barbarossa, the Emperor. The fleeing prince was well received by Barbarossa, from
whom he begged aid. We know not what reward Vladimir offered Bela, for reinstating
him in Galitch, but we know exactly his agreement with Frederick Barbarossa. He bound
himself to pay two thousand silver grievens yearly for his restoration. There were
other reasons, too, why the Emperor became interested. He was astonished to see before
him the nephew of Andrei Bogolyubski and of Vsevolod (Big Nest). Hearing that he was
a son of a sister of those two famous princes, he doubted not that he was an important
man. He had grown acquainted with Andrei Bogolyubski through letters, when that prince
was building his cathedral in Vladimir. Because of those letters, various artists
and materials had gone from Germany. Of Big Nest and his eminence among Russian princes,
reports were frequent. To aid Vladimir would cause the Emperor no trouble. He had
no thought to help with men. He was going then to Palestine, but Poland was subject
to his influence, and he commissioned Kazimir, King of Poland, to reinstate the exile.
The Poles envied Hungarians Galitch, and were glad to expel them.
</p>
<p>Vladimir, leading a Polish army, entered Galitch very easily. When the return of their
native prince was announced, the people rushed to meet him. Flight was all that was
left for Andrei and those Russian boyars who adhered to him. While the Hungarian was
fleeing as best he was able, and bearing with him the title <i>Rex Galiciæ</i>, which remains to this day on the shield of his country, Vladimir took the throne;
and he held it as long as there was breath in his nostrils. He held it, thanks to
Big Nest, his uncle, <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>because of this message: “My lord and father, keep Galitch under me, I pray thee.
I belong to God and to thee with all Galitch.” Big Nest listened to Vladimir’s entreaty,
and kept him firmly in Galitch till his death came.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav, “the sister’s son,” insisted that Kief should have the boundaries established
as in the days of Rostislav’s father, that is he wanted Kief to have Vyshgorod and
Bailgorod, with other towns in the Ros River region, taken from it by the sons of
Rostislav. Disputes became bitter, and the princes were near deciding the question
by force of arms. Rurik and David sent back their oath papers, and Sviatoslav declared
that he would not yield in any case. In Smolensk the princes turned to Big Nest, saying:
“We have accepted thee as father; judge this question for us.” Big Nest sided with
Smolensk, and sent to Sviatoslav, saying: “The conditions on which thou wert confirmed
are those to which we adhere. If thou still adhere to the same conditions, we will
be with thee in peace; but seek not to rouse old disputes, and desert agreements,
for we will not permit thee.” Sviatoslav yielded. Thenceforth he made no mention of
lands for Kief, till he tried to get them by giving Galitch to Roman in exchange for
them. Not succeeding in this, he wished, both for himself and to please his brethren
in Chernigoff, to round out and to defend their inheritance on the Ryazan side. Their
possessions touching the Oká and Ryazan were subject to ceaseless attacks from Ryazan,
whose princes laid claim to them. All the Chernigoff house assembled at Karachef,
under Sviatoslav’s direction. They declared at that meeting that war alone could settle
boundaries. The princes were ready to war with Ryazan in a body, but Sviatoslav could
not decide to begin, or let his relatives begin, without the consent of Big Nest,
Prince of Vladimir, so he sent to ask advice of him. From Big Nest came the answer
that he forbade Chernigoff princes to open war on Ryazan, and all obeyed him.
</p>
<p>Before this meeting ended, Sviatoslav fell ill for the last time. “Something appeared
on his leg.” Thus his disease was described. Unable to sit on his horse, he was borne
in a sleigh to the river, for traveling in a wheeled vehicle over those roads would
have caused him great pain; then he sailed down the Desna and the Dnieper. Arriving
in Kief, he went first of all to pray in the church of Boris and Glaib, and afterward
to bow down and pray at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>tomb of his father, but the priest had gone away and taken the key of the church with
him, hence the prince did not see his father’s grave. He reached home broken completely.
</p>
<p>On the wedding day of Euphemia, his granddaughter, who had been betrothed to the heir
of Byzantium, envoys from the Emperor came, but Sviatoslav took no part in the matter
beyond appointing certain boyars to receive them. He grew weak, ceased speaking, and
fell into a torpor. Recovering after a time, he commanded a monk’s habit to be brought,
and sent for Rurik, who found him alive, but not in his senses. So far as is known,
no word passed between them. Afterward, when Rurik had gone, the dying man regained
consciousness and, turning to the princess, asked: “When will the day of the Maccabees
be?” July was ending, and he remembered August 1, that day of death for his father
and his grandfather. “Next Monday,” answered the princess. He looked into her eyes,
as if to be sure that he saw her, and said: “I shall not live to the day of the Maccabees.”
He died July 27, 1194.
</p>
<p>The next Prince of Kief was Rurik, son of Rostislav, but he had to get the consent
of Big Nest, whom he and his brothers had long recognized as their senior, and esteemed
as a father. Big Nest was not opposed to Rurik, for Rurik’s son, Rostislav, had married
Verhuslava, his favorite daughter; hence he sent his boyars to confirm the new prince.
Soon the relationship was strengthened by another bond: the Prince of Vladimir found
a bride in Smolensk for his eldest son, Constantine, who married the daughter of Mystislav,
son of Roman the Mild. Later on, this prince became Prince of Kief, and fell in the
battle with Mongols on the Kalka.
</p>
<p>So Rurik and David grew nearer to the Prince of Vladimir. Since the older line of
Monomach, descended from Mystislav the Great, and the younger line, descended from
Yuri Dolgoruki, were so united, all the descendants of Monomach were now in accord
and friendship.
</p>
<p>The great man of Volynia, Roman, had married Rurik’s daughter. The other Volynia princes,
heirs of Yaroslav of Lutsk, were insignificant in those days. Roman, who had not shown
great respect for Rurik at any time, ceased to care for him after he reached Kief
dominion. To Roman’s thinking, the oldest throne in Russia should be held by the strongest
of its princes, a man who could <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>govern wisely, defend the Russian land in all places, and preserve order so that no
prince could offend another, none attack and ravage a neighboring province. “But,”
said he, “we see the very opposite. The throne of Kief is seized by senseless rulers,
who not only are unable to manage others and stop strife among relatives, but are
unable to defend their own borders; hence they bring in pagan Polovtsi, and ruin the
country. For this, Big Nest is to blame.” Such was Roman’s opinion of his father-in-law.
</p>
<p>Later on, from the enmity of these two men, disputes came among the southern princes.
Rurik lost the throne of Kief repeatedly, while Roman, without ruling Kief, acquired
so much fame among princes that they saw in him the one southern ruler. Meanwhile
both Rurik and Roman recognized the superiority of Big Nest, who mixed in their quarrels,
as he did in general in all quarrels of princes, only in so far as those quarrels
subserved his own interest; aside from that, he let them alone, and for this many
people blamed him. He reinstated certain princes against others, thus weakening one
through the other, and finding means to strengthen himself through their dissensions.
Rurik, in the first year of his reign, 1195, felt this keen policy of Big Nest. When
Rurik ascended the Kief throne, and had been greeted by envoys from Big Nest, he thanked
the Vladimir prince with many expressions of friendship. Delighted over his confirmation,
he invited his brother David to Kief. “Behold,” said he in a letter, “thou and I are
now seniors in Russia. Come hither to Kief to take counsel. We will think over everything,
and settle all questions.”
</p>
<p>After such an invitation, David went promptly from Smolensk down the Dnieper. Rurik
met him at Vyshgorod, and invited him to a banquet. He arranged a great festival for
David and his children. They passed the time in rejoicing and gladness. Then Rostislav,
heir of the Kief prince, with Verhuslava, his princess, had a family festival in Bailgorod
in honor of David, and gave him great gifts. After that David invited the Kief prince
and his children to a dinner. Next he gave a feast to all monks, and bestowed many
gifts on the poor and on monasteries. Finally he made a feast for the Cherkasi. All
drank their fill, and received rich presents at parting. Then the Kief citizens wished
to give a dinner to David. He accepted their hospitality, and Kief played <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>the host to him. David then could not fail to give a dinner and presents to the citizens
of Kief, so he invited them to a feast, and at that feast there was “mighty pleasure
for all men.”
</p>
<p>While these feasts were in progress the brothers were occupied seriously. They arranged
the whole family and divided up all the regions and provinces among them. Rurik rewarded
his son-in-law richly. He gave Roman Korchesk, Kaneff, Tripol, Korsun and Bogulov.
In one word, the best towns in the Ros region, and kissed the cross not to withdraw
them at any time.
</p>
<p>When news of these festivals came to the city of Vladimir no special joy was expressed
there. Whether Big Nest was offended that nothing had been given him in the south,
or whether he wished to cause Rurik and Roman to quarrel with each other is unknown,
but he sent envoys to Kief with this message: “Ye have called me the eldest among
the descendants of Monomach, and now, my brother and friend, thou hast bestowed all
the lands on thy younger brothers, and given me no share whatever. If there be no
part for me, let it be so. Thou art in the Kief region apart; to whom thou wilt, thou
mayest give, and with them care for it,—I am needed no longer. But we shall see how
thou wilt hold Kief without me.”
</p>
<p>Confused by a turn so unlooked for, Rurik was ready for any arrangement, and desired
Vsevolod to choose from places that he, Rurik, still had at his disposal. But the
Prince of Vladimir asked for those very places which Rurik had already given to Roman.
Rurik tried to induce Roman to yield the towns, saying that in return he might take
whatever places pleased him. Roman would not hear of this. He threatened war. An outcry
was raised throughout the whole Kief region. All inclined now toward Roman. They condemned
Rurik’s yielding proposal, and pointed with wrath at the action of Big Nest, saying
that it recalled the old claims of Yuri Dolgoruki, and his struggle with the grandfather
of Roman. They demanded that the metropolitan should examine the papers and treaties
preserved in the treasury of Holy Sophia. They pointed out that Rurik’s predecessor
had yielded Novgorod in favor of Vsevolod, and let him manage that city on condition
that he dropped his claim on Kief. “By the treaties which are still preserved, it
is clear,” said they, “that Vsevolod resigned Kief.” But the more they argued, the
more did the Vladimir prince insist, and the more threateningly did he inform <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>the Kief men that he was ready to meet them, even with war, should the need come.
</p>
<p>In this difficulty, Rurik turned for advice to Nikifor, the metropolitan. “We are
placed here by God to keep you from bloodshed,” replied the metropolitan. “As I see
that you cannot avoid it, because you considered the towns not as belonging to the
elder, but the younger, I will remove from you the oath, and take the sin on my own
soul. I permit you to take back the towns from the younger, and give them to the elder.
But listen to me in this, also: Instead of what thou takest from Roman, give him its
equal in value.” Rurik took this advice, promised his son-in-law the full value of
what he relinquished, and satisfied him, apparently. In every case when he yielded
the Ros towns, Roman sent this submissive answer: “It is not for thee to quarrel with
the Prince of Vladimir because of me. Give him the places for which he asks, and because
of which he complains of me, and instead of them, thou wilt give me other lands, or
the value of them.”
</p>
<p>Rurik now announced to Big Nest that he gave him the five towns in question. Thus
the affair was ended. The Prince of Vladimir, meanwhile, to the astonishment of all,
showed that he did not value the towns, because of which he was ready for war. The
principal one he gave back to Rurik immediately. Torchesk he gave to his son-in-law,
Rostislav; to the others he paid little heed, sending insignificant men to manage
them. Roman saw in this a new slight. Whether he suspected some plan on the part of
Rurik, or knew clearly that he was innocent, he lost the last trace of respect which
till then he had shown in a small way for his father-in-law. He accused him of inability
to rule Kief, and concluded an alliance with Oleg’s descendants against him. He negotiated
with them openly to expel the Kief prince; and advised his wife, Rurik’s daughter,
to enter a convent.
</p>
<p>Rurik tried to reason with Roman, and explain their relations: “I gave thee those
places, and when the Prince of Vladimir complained that I did not show him due honor,
I declared all his words to thee. Thou didst agree to relinquish those places. As
is known to thee, we cannot work against the Vladimir prince. We, Monomach’s descendants,
made him the elder. Thou wilt have regions equal to those given to him.”
</p>
<p>But Roman was simply feigning offense when he reproached <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>Rurik. In fact he was seeking reproaches, and had no wish at all to agree with him.
When at last Rurik learned that his son-in-law had kissed the cross with Yaroslav
of Chernigoff to occupy Kief, he sent envoys to cast his written oath at the feet
of the traitor. He wrote then to Big Nest, explaining Roman’s treason—and a general
war was soon in preparation.
</p>
<p>Roman, alarmed at Rurik’s act in casting down the oath papers, and fearing that prince’s
powerful ally, Vsevolod of Vladimir, not to lose time by negotiation, took his military
following and marched straight to Cracow, where he had a few time-serving friends
and some temporary allies. Kazimir the Just, Roman’s uncle, had died in 1194. His
widow, Yelena, the daughter of Vsevolod, Roman’s brother, and her children, the heirs
of the late king, rejoiced at his coming, but instead of giving aid they begged aid
of Roman against Mechislav, who would not recognize Kazimir’s son, Leshko, as king,
though he had been placed on the throne by all the estates.
</p>
<p>“We should be glad to assist thee,” said Leshko, “but we cannot while Mechislav, my
uncle, attacks me. Give aid against him, and when we have conquered, we will go as
one man to assist thee.” This plan of giving all Poland to Leshko, and then, with
its aid, to win primacy in Russia seemed pleasing to Roman. “I will get my mind’s
wish now,” thought he.
</p>
<p>Mechislav did not desire war with Roman, and begged that prince, through envoys, to
mediate between him and Leshko. Roman’s Russian intimates advised compliance with
this request, but, listening neither to them nor the envoys, he attacked Mechislav
with his own men and those of his nephew. His thought: “I will get my mind’s wish,”
was not realized this time, however, for Mechislav gained a great victory. Roman,
so severely wounded that he could not sit on a horse, was borne back to Cracow on
a litter, and thence to Volynia in the same way.
</p>
<p>Thus ended at that time the great plans of Roman. When leaving Cracow, he urged his
Polish relatives not to be cast down in spirit, and promised to help them as soon
as he had assembled his forces. Knowing his father-in-law’s weakness, he sent him
a message of penitence and implored the metropolitan Nikifor to speak for him. Rurik
was delighted. “Since Roman is sorry and repents,” said he, “I will let him kiss the
cross again, and give <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>him provinces. He will honor me now as a father, I will call him my son again, I have
wished him well at all times.”
</p>
<p>In fact Roman received new lands. Rurik, in pacifying his son-in-law in this way,
wished to ward off Chernigoff princes roused against him by Roman. In treating of
this matter, Big Nest and Rurik sent a message to the descendants of Oleg in the name
of all the descendants of Monomach, as follows: “Kiss the cross to us that ye will
not seek to take from us, or our descendants, or any descendant of Monomach, our Kief
inheritance and Smolensk.” Referring to the ancient ordinance which left to the ancestor
of all the descendants of Oleg the Chernigoff region as far west as the Dnieper, they
added: “Ye do not need Kief.”
</p>
<p>The descendants of Oleg met in counsel, and sent this answer to the Prince of Vladimir:
“We adhere to our agreement, which was that we would not try to take Kief from you,
or your relatives. But if we are to lose Kief forever, we answer that we are not Poles
or Hungarians, but grandsons of one grandfather. During thy life we will not strive
for Kief, but after thy death, let it go to whom God will give it.”
</p>
<p>Such a decided reply troubled Big Nest considerably, and brought Rurik to confusion.
He begged the Vladimir prince insistently to make war on Chernigoff. Big Nest promised
“to mount his horse,” and commanded his warriors to assemble. Even Novgorod took the
field at his order. But at the same time he received with pleasure envoys from Chernigoff,
who declared that they had no thought to offend him. Big Nest dismounted, and commanded
the Novgorod men to return to their city. We can understand easily this action of
Big Nest. The demand made on Chernigoff, not only to abstain from seeking Kief, but
also from entering Smolensk lands, showed the cause of the fear which disturbed Rurik,
and concerned even Big Nest, though he considered it without direct interest. This
question touched Drutsk, Vitebsk and neighboring places which, because they were near
Chernigoff borders, were seized frequently by Smolensk princes. If the Chernigoff
princes could not get these lands themselves, they preferred that the Polotsk princes
should have them. The great point was that Smolensk should not get them. Now David,
Rurik’s son, had seized Vitebsk, and therefore was in open enmity with Yaroslav of
Chernigoff. To end this quarrel, Rurik promised to <span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>discuss the question with his brother. He laid down the condition that Chernigoff
should not take arms till negotiations were finished. But the Chernigoff princes,
who had prepared for war some months earlier, being roused now by Roman, were unwilling
to wait for the end of negotiations between Smolensk and Kief, and began war that
same winter to win the Smolensk border, where it touched their possessions on the
Polotsk side.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav of Chernigoff sent forward Oleg, his nephew, and the Polotsk princes helped
him. David, Rurik’s brother, sent against them his nephew, Mystislav, son-in-law of
Big Nest. The first battle came out very strangely. The Chernigoff princes were thrown
into confusion, and their banners were trampled by Smolensk. When Oleg’s son, David,
was pursued by Mystislav of Smolensk, and Oleg was growing weak from attacks of the
enemy, the Smolensk men were put to flight by a Polotsk onset. Since Smolensk was
now beaten by Chernigoff, the Polotsk warriors ceased to pursue other Smolensk men,
and turning, fell on the rear of Mystislav’s regiment and trampled it. Mystislav himself
was following one of Oleg’s divisions. When he turned, after stopping pursuit, he
thought that he would see his own men, that Chernigoff was conquered, but, to his
amazement, he found not his men, but Polotsk warriors in front of him. They recognized
him, and he was seized at once. Others, returning from the pursuit of Oleg of Chernigoff,
beheld from afar the Polotsk triumph, and fled, as did all the men of Smolensk.
</p>
<p>Freed from pursuers, and discovering the Polotsk men, Oleg could scarcely believe
his senses. Straightway he sent this message to Yaroslav, his uncle: “I have captured
Mystislav; I have beaten his army and the army of David and the Smolensk men. O father,
such a time will not come again. March without delay. Put all our forces together.
We will get our honor back!”
</p>
<p>On receiving this message, Yaroslav, with Igor and all the descendants of Oleg, joined
their forces for the expedition. They wished to fall upon Smolensk unexpectedly, but
when Rurik of Kief was going from the capital to take rest in his favorite residence,
Ovrutch, he sent his oath papers to Yaroslav with these words: “If in thy joy thou
art going to kill my brother, here are thy oath papers. If thou go to Smolensk, I
will go to Chernigoff. Let us see how God and the holy cross will judge between us.”
Because <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>of this threat, Yaroslav did not go to Smolensk, but returned to Chernigoff, and the
two princes, Rurik of Kief and Yaroslav of Chernigoff, continued to send envoys to
each other with reproaches of oath breaking. Yaroslav declared that he had not broken
his oath, but that the real blame was on David, son of Rostislav, who had seized Vitebsk.
There were many disputes and high words between them, and they came to no agreement.
Thereupon Rurik sent this message to Big Nest: “Since thou didst agree with David
and me to set out about Christmas, and meet us near Chernigoff, I joined him with
troops and wild Polovtsi, and waited all winter; thou didst not move, thinking that
the Chernigoff princes would not attack us. In view of this, I dismissed David and
the Polovtsi, and Yaroslav and I kissed the cross not to raise arms against each other
till we had agreed or failed in agreement. Now Mystislav is sitting in chains in Chernigoff.
If we should delay longer, wilt thou mount thy horse and declare where we are to assemble?
Avenge the offense and remove the shame. Let us free Mystislav, and get justice.”
</p>
<p>Big Nest gave no answer that summer. In the autumn, when Rurik had summoned his brethren
and the Polovtsi, he marched on Chernigoff. Then Yaroslav of Chernigoff sent this
message to Rurik: “My brother, why dost thou wage war on my country and use pagans
to help thee? Thou hast done me no harm, and I am not seeking thy capital. If thy
brother sent his nephew against me, God judged between me and Mystislav. I ask no
ransom for Mystislav; I am ready to free him. Kiss the cross to me that thou wilt
bring me to friendship with David, thy brother, and that thou hast no plot with Big
Nest, whether I settle with him or fail in a settlement.” Rurik, without restraining
the Polovtsi, began now to negotiate, demanding that Yaroslav should let his envoys
pass to Smolensk and Vladimir. But the Chernigoff prince feared, and with reason,
that the labors of those envoys would be directed against him; hence he closed all
of his lands to the Kief prince. War continued till winter. To one sorrow was added
another in Yaroslav’s case, for the bravest of all the descendants of Oleg, Vsevolod
Buitur of Trubchenvsk, died and was buried “amid mighty wailing and weeping.” They
were roused from this sadness by delight at a friendship proposed by the Prince of
Volynia.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>Roman raised weapons now against Rurik. The Kief prince received news at the same
time from his son Rostislav and from David, his brother, that Roman had attacked their
possessions. Thereupon he summoned to Kief Mystislav the Gallant, and sent him to
Galitch to Vladimir, son of Eight Minds, and nephew of Big Nest, so that both might
march into the lands of Volynia. Rurik, to rouse the Galitch prince greatly, gave
command to say to him: “I would go myself with thee, but Big Nest has mounted and
is marching to help me against the descendants of Oleg; we have decided to meet near
Chernigoff.”
</p>
<p>In fact Big Nest with David, Rurik’s brother, had entered the land of the Vyatichi.
They burned town after town and devastated the country. After this storm, Yaroslav
of Chernigoff prepared for a siege. Leaving his nephews in the capital to defend it,
he took Igor of Novgorod-Seversk and a force of wild Polovtsi, and went to meet Big
Nest and David. In that forest region of the Vyatichi, he felled trees and erected
barriers for defense. He destroyed bridges, and made all roads and crossings as difficult
as possible. Then he sent his most eminent men to lay terms of peace before Big Nest,
but also a word of decision. “My brother and relative,” said he, “thou hast seized
our bread and our inheritance, but, if it is thy true wish to agree and be in accord
with us, we do not flee from agreement, and will act with thee. We will liberate Mystislav
without ransom. If thou hast plans against us, we will not avoid meeting thee. Let
God and the Holy Saviour give judgment.”
</p>
<p>Big Nest called a council of the Ryazan princes who were with him. At this council,
he declared that there was no reason for the war now, as he thought, and that he wished
to give peace to Chernigoff. David was indignant. “How?” asked he. “Thou hast stipulated
with Rurik, my brother, and me to meet us both at Chernigoff, and make peace only
there, and as we all agreed. Rurik waits with impatience for news from us, while fighting
with his force against Chernigoff. For me and for thee he has let his whole country
be covered with fire, and now we wish to make peace without him. I tell thee sincerely
that such a peace will not please my brother.” But, in spite of David’s protest, Big
Nest stopped the advance and began to negotiate.
</p>
<p>At this time Yaropolk, son of Yaroslav of Chernigoff, was Prince <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>of Novgorod, called there by the Novgorod men some months earlier. Big Nest demanded
that Yaropolk leave Novgorod. Mystislav must be freed without ransom, and then he
advised that Chernigoff abandon the alliance with Roman. All these conditions were
accepted save the last. Finally the negotiations were concluded with a strict and
precise obligation on the part of Chernigoff, without mentioning alliances, not to
strive to take Kief or Smolensk from Rurik or David. The Vladimir prince gave peace
on this basis. “I have made peace with Yaroslav. He has kissed the cross not to seek
Kief from thee, or Smolensk from thy brother,” was his message to Rurik.
</p>
<p>Rurik flashed up with rage at these words, and sent a reproach, not an answer to Big
Nest. “Thou didst kiss the cross to me that whoso was my enemy was thine also. Thou
didst ask of me a share in Southern Russia, and I gave thee the best province, not
from excess of land at my disposal, since I was forced to take the land from Roman,
and he is for that cause my enemy. No matter how many promises thou didst make to
help me, thou didst pass the winter and summer in promises. How didst thou assist
me, and how didst thou finish that touching which thou didst kiss the cross with me?”
And the enraged Rurik took back those towns on the Ros which he had given to Big Nest.
Big Nest, though very angry, paid no heed to this action. He had given already, as
we know, the best towns to Rurik and to Rurik’s son, Rostislav.
</p>
<p>Thus rose the quarrel between the Kief prince and the Prince of Vladimir, a complete
break between relatives. That this was a bad move for Rurik, and that he would not
remain in Kief long, seemed clear to most men; his fall appeared certain. In addition
to this trouble, he lost David, his best friend and defender, who died in Smolensk
in 1197. The throne of Smolensk and the lands around Kief which belonged to him, David
left to Mystislav, son of Roman, the oldest in his family. His children he committed
to Rurik.
</p>
<p>That Rurik was weakened in Kief and had lowered its dignity, Roman was more convinced
now than ever. Divorced from Rurik’s daughter, he sent her to her father and married
a second time. Rurik, however, held Kief for some years after this. Meanwhile Roman
was collecting strength to get his “mind’s wish,” <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>and later it came to him; for soon he reached immense power for that place and period.
About this time the bravest of Oleg’s descendants, Vsevolod, son of Sviatoslav, died
and disappeared from the field of activity. The Chernigoff prince, Rostislav, died
in 1198, and his throne was occupied, according to seniority, by Igor of Novgorod-Seversk.
Two years later “Rushing Bull” the hero of the Slovo died. Among the descendants of
Oleg, Vsevolod Chermny, son of Sviatoslav “the sister’s son,” became prominent, and
soon occupied the first place. The decease of these older men was not followed by
any disorder, but a little later, Vladimir, son of Eight Minds, died, and as he left
no heir his death caused immense changes and brought after it endless disturbance
throughout Southern Russia. The Hungarians and Poles struggled for his possessions,
but were set aside promptly by Roman, who having once held the Galitch throne never
again turned his eyes from it.
</p>
<p>Bela of Hungary, who still called himself “King of Galicia,” hurried straightway with
his troops to take possession of Galitch, but Roman moved his forces still more quickly.
He had planned to arm Poland against Hungary, its permanent rival, and hastening to
Cracow turned again to Leshko, for whom he had shed his blood some years earlier.
Taking him and his forces, he anticipated Bela and was in the capital before him.
The Hungarians, hearing of Roman’s success, fell back beyond the Carpathians. The
men of Galitch, who had opened the city to Roman, seated him on the throne of Volodar,
Vladimirko and Eight Minds. The new ruler surpassed without exception all who had
preceded him; with his strong mind and heroic manner, it could not be otherwise.
</p>
<p>Galitch and Volynia, through the character of the people and the nature of the country,
formed one possession. From the time that they were separated through violence by
Vsevolod, son of Monomach, who died in 1093 (he separated them for the benefit of
the landless “orphan” princes), disputes touching boundaries had been continual between
princes of Galitch and Volynia. The first prince who held both lands was Roman. It
should be remembered that Galitch in those days extended to the Danube, and included
the present Roumania. Roman took Galitch without a struggle, because the people there
helped him. They had learned to fear foreign rule, hence received him as the prince
of their <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>wishes; they would have no prince but Roman. The Poles boasted, however, that thanks
to them Roman was seated in Galitch, and in later years, when Roman had been slain,
and while his two sons were still children, they robbed Volynia and plundered Galitch.
Polish boasting and the really close relationship between Mazovian and Volynian princes
gave rise to the fable and claim in Poland that those lands were an ancient appanage
of Poland. After Roman’s death, they were claimed by the Poles as their own lands,
which their princes through kindness had given, as they averred, for temporary use
to Russian princes, their relatives.
</p>
<p>But come what might, Leshko was glad that they had stopped the Hungarians, who in
their turn were glad that Galitch had gone from the Poles to their opponents. Both
sides feared Roman and made a proverb declaring him to be “as brave as a bull, as
pugnacious as a rat, and as deadly as a crocodile.”
</p>
<p>Andrei, the former “King of Galicia,” raised no claim during Roman’s time. Polish
princes sought Roman’s friendship, and not only made no attack on his territory, but
feared lest he might demand of them lands which were formerly Russian, but had been
seized by Polish princes.
</p>
<p>Roman was feared still more by his enemies in Galitch. Almost all the boyars were
traitors to the people through their love of power and delight in loose living, in
which they resembled their western neighbors. To raise themselves high above the people
and bind them in absolute slavery, so as to hold Galitch as the Poles and Hungarians
held their lands, was the ideal of those boyars, and that is why they yielded so gladly
to Hungary. These tendencies they exalted, of course, as love of country, and sacrifice
for the fatherland. But the keen Roman saw through such pretenses. His opponents said
that he acted inhumanly with the boyars of Galitch. During his short reign he destroyed
many of them. His enemies declared that he quartered boyars, shot them, or buried
them alive; that when they fled he lured them back by promises of kindness, and when,
trusting in his words, they returned, he delivered them to torrents. The truth is
that at the time of his first occupation of Galitch, he saw its disorders most clearly.
That which his own eyes beheld fully convinced him that the boyars who pretended to
care for and toil in the interest of the country were the ones who gave it up to a
Latin prince and a foreigner, <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>and he would not spare traitors. When he settled finally in Galitch, he was forced
to take mighty measures against men who were at once his opponents and the enemies
of the people. There is no doubt that the greater part of them fled from Roman’s anger,
withdrawing in season to Hungary. Those who remained, he either put to death, or reduced
to obedience. For this he received from the chroniclers not blame but thanks, and
the title “Single Ruler of Galitch.” He reigned with glory, possessing all Carpathian
Russia, that is, ruling alone on the banks of the Dniester, the Pruth, the Seret in
the Danube regions, in places which are now Roumania, and in the Volynian lands in
addition.
</p>
<p>Rome sought now more intimate relations with Roman, but all attempts failed and further
approach was deferred till a more favorable period, which did not come during Roman’s
days. In the short interval from 1197 to 1201, Galitch and Volynia held the first
place in Southern Russia. In other principalities, nothing happened of interest. Big
Nest’s whole activity was confined to Vladimir, except that he renewed Gorodok and
strengthened its Kremlin, and sent Yaroslav, his son, to Pereyaslavl, thus making
it clear that he had part in Southern Russia. With Rurik of Kief he stopped all relations.
The Polovtsi did not trouble Kief during this period, but their new day was coming.
</p>
<p>Of all the descendants of Monomach and even of Oleg, “those ancient allies of the
wild Polovtsi,” there was no prince in history so intimate with those steppe men as
Rurik. He wished to be friends with every horde without exception, and in cases of
need they were ready to serve him. It was not stated in chronicles without good reason
that “the pagans delighted in Rurik, for he received all with love, whether Christians
or pagans, and sent away no man unsatisfied.”
</p>
<p>In 1202 came the end of peace. In that year began wars without number, and expeditions
which plunged the whole country into gloom. As soon as Rurik had made a firm treaty
with the princes of Chernigoff, he hastened to use it. He resolved to humiliate Roman.
The Chernigoff princes joined this league against Roman, and persuaded all descendants
of Oleg to be with them. Chermny, the Chernigoff prince, went to Kief with his brethren,
to help Rurik against the “Single Ruler of Galitch” and his kinsmen who managed under
him in Volynia. These allied princes could not <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>forgive Roman for taking Galitch without their consent, and without sharing it with
another; they also envied him his swift exaltation. It was learned besides that Roman
had come to an agreement with Big Nest, whom alone he considered as his senior. And,
to finish the matter, it had been decided between those two princes to give the Kief
throne to Ingvar, son of Yaroslav of Volynia.
</p>
<p>But, while sitting in Galitch, the golden-domed capital of Eight Minds, Roman knew
well what was happening in Kief, the old capital. Marching swiftly, he anticipated
his enemies and forestalled their campaign. The Cherkasi and the Black Caps rose to
a man and went forth gladly to join the on-marching regiments of Volynia and Galitch.
Kief and the towns around it were excited in favor of Roman. While the allies were
talking over the future division of Bailgorod, Vyshgorod and other towns, and also
the partition of Galitch; while they were planning the positions of the regiments
and the hordes of Polovtsi, Roman, supported by the population, approached Kief on
a sudden. The inhabitants opened the gates, and he marched in without opposition.
He occupied Podol, the lower part of the city, and sent to Rurik, who was in the hill
part, demanding surrender. In view of the fact that the people had opened the gates
and were ready for a general uprising, the allies made no resistance whatever. Roman
brought them all to kiss the cross to him; he kissed it also in this,—that he did
not take Kief for himself. He then permitted them to withdraw from the city and go
to their homes. Rurik went to his Ovrutch, and the Chernigoff princes to their lands
east of the Dnieper. Then, deferring to Big Nest, Roman seated Ingvar, son of Yaroslav,
on the Kief throne. After this, Roman won the double love of the people by a campaign
against the Polovtsi, “the wild ones.” Instead of the plunder of Galitch promised
the Polovtsi by Rurik, they had now to pay dearly for assisting him. Roman seized
their towns and made a vast number of prisoners. He freed Christian captives, and
the delight at his victory was unbounded.
</p>
<p>Thus began a new reign in Kief. But while Ingvar sat there no one dreamed of calling
him Grand Prince, for he was simply a lieutenant; moreover his rule had but one feature
of brightness,—its brevity.
</p>
<p>The vanquished Rurik and Oleg’s descendants, who had been humiliated, could not forgive
the Kief people their treason, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>prepared to take vengeance. A crime was committed then that has not its like in Kief
history. Though many evils had come upon the mother city they were slight in comparison
with this one. Rurik with his people and Chermny with his troops, in January, 1204,
brought to Kief countless legions of Polovtsi, promising those savage warriors and
wild men of the steppes the plunder of the capital. It was said that “the whole land
of the Polovtsi” was present. Kief was taken by storm; not only did the Polovtsi sack
all the lower town, but they rushed to the upper part; they plundered the monasteries,
Sophia cathedral, and the Tithe church; they stripped the holy images, and carried
away the consecrated vessels and crosses. “The wild ones” seized the precious robes
of ancient princes, of Saint Vladimir and his son, Yaroslav the Lawgiver, and other
robes which had been kept in the churches and revered as sacred relics. The city was
blazing. Along the streets captive people were driven in multitudes. Foreign merchants
defended themselves in the stone churches so manfully that the Polovtsi bargained
with them, taking a part of their merchandise as ransom.
</p>
<p>In general, the Polovtsi spared neither the great nor the insignificant, the rich
nor the indigent. A multitude of old monks and nuns, and also the parish clergy, were
slain with lances or cut down with swords, as were the lame, the blind, and all useless
people. The healthy and young were taken captive. Not a house was left unplundered.
In the churches not one sacred vessel was spared, or one holy image with its ornaments.
When they had sated themselves with plunder and withdrawn from the city, Kief was
a smoking ruin; only the groans of the dying broke the silence. The streets, stained
with blood, were covered with corpses.
</p>
<p>People afterward called to mind many prophecies and omens given during that year:
one night, for example, the heavens suddenly appeared as if dyed with blood; on the
streets and in the houses each object seemed blood-covered. Men saw how stars torn
from the sky fell to the earth. This phenomenon terrified all who witnessed it. People
thought that the end of life was approaching. It seemed now that the destruction of
Kief had been foretold by those heavenly wonders. “It might have been so, for what
could be more awful than the ruin of Kief by its own princes. Had such a crime ever
been heard of in the world till that day?” <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>But the words describing its terrors had not ceased to sound among people, when they
were drowned by an outcry still more terrible.
</p>
<p>A tale came from afar giving an account of a new and dreadful woe to all people of
the Orthodox world. Tsargrad had been taken by the Latins. The Western Crusaders had
seized the capital of the Emperors, had plundered it to the last object, and had robbed
and slaughtered people too numerous for reckoning. They had entered Holy Sophia, had
torn off the door, and cut in pieces the ambo covered with silver; they had stripped
the wonderful altar, had taken all the precious stones and candlesticks, the Gospels
bound in gold and silver, the holy crosses and the priceless images<span class="corr" id="xd32e1609" title="Source: ,">.</span> Other churches without number in the city and outside the city and the monasteries
they had stripped naked. “The number of these and their beauty could not be recounted
or described by any man.” Thus had fallen the God-preserved city of Tsargrad, the
capital of the empire and of the land of the Greeks.
</p>
<p>These two deeds, the capture of Kief by Rurik and the Polovtsi, and the capture of
Tsargrad by the Latins, happened in the same year, 1204. Rurik, chief destroyer of
Kief, not daring to set foot in the capital, went back to Ovrutch. Ingvar buried himself
for the rest of his life in Volynia.
</p>
<p>Roman, not believing his ears when he learned of the terrible destruction of Kief,
wished to hear from Rurik himself the explanation, and went from Galitch directly
to Ovrutch. We know not what Rurik told Roman, who for his own selfish purposes greatly
desired to detach Rurik from the princes of Chernigoff and from the Polovtsi. Rurik
was willing to desert them, or at least to promise to do so, if Kief might be his
again. Whatever the result was, both parties were dissatisfied. Apparently Roman did
not wish, in view of detaching Rurik from Chernigoff and the Polovtsi, to refuse him
the Kief throne. Being friendly with Big Nest, and knowing his dislike for the Kief
prince, since he had contributed to Rurik’s disgrace, and the establishment of Ingvar,
Roman arranged in this way: he declared to Rurik that to confirm a prince in Kief
did not depend on him, the Prince of Galitch, and advised Rurik to turn with his request
to Big Nest, promising to write himself to the Prince of Vladimir touching the matter.
He made this promise, believing that Big Nest would reject the proposal. But, in this
case, Big Nest did not justify Roman’s expectation. <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>The Grand Prince of Vladimir, to the utter amazement of all persons, gave his consent
to the return of Rurik, and no one, save Roman, could explain the act, otherwise than
as due to the marvelous good nature of Big Nest. “This merciful prince,” said the
people, “does not remember Rurik’s crimes, or even the offense which he himself has
endured from him.” But Roman apparently explained this unexpected act differently,
and, not wishing Rurik’s return, took his own course.
</p>
<p>In 1205, the following year, when Rurik was prince in Kief again, Roman strengthened
his earlier friendship with Chernigoff, and with Yaroslav, son of Big Nest, ruling
at that time in Pereyaslavl on the Alta. Then he went to Rurik with regiments from
Volynia and Galitch, and announced a campaign against the Polovtsi. No matter how
Rurik might favor the Polovtsi, he could not refuse to fight against the enemies of
his country. The sacred cry raised all Southern Russia. A general arming took place,
and under Roman a successful campaign was made. The Polovtsi were beaten, as they
had not been beaten for a long time. Many captives were rescued, and much of the wealth
seized in Kief at the sacking of the city was restored. Roman won immense honor, and
the gratitude shown him was general.
</p>
<p>But to conquer the Polovtsi was not the only, or perhaps the chief reason for this
expedition. On their return, Rurik was removed from the Kief throne. We know not how
this was effected; we know only that Roman did it indirectly. This is shown by the
fact that he took home with him to Galitch Rurik’s two sons, Vladimir and Rostislav,
the former a son-in-law of Big Nest. Rurik himself became a monk, while his daughters
and wife were forced to enter a convent. No one doubted that Rurik took the habit
through compulsion from Roman. When Big Nest heard of these acts, he was angry, but
only because the husband of his favorite daughter was, as he thought, a captive in
Galitch. He demanded the instant liberation of both brothers. To this Roman answered,
not merely with perfect compliance, but he made an addition: Rostislav was not only
set free, he was placed on the Kief throne.
</p>
<p>Roman proposed now a meeting in Kief of all the ruling princes to discuss and establish
new rules which he intended to lay before the assembly. These rules were in substance
as follows: To prevent <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>local princes from becoming insignificant, they must be stopped from dividing their
lands, and made to give rule to the eldest son only. At the death of the Grand Prince,
the other ruling princes were to choose from among them the man most deserving of
primacy. The princes did not like this proposal, but not wishing, or perhaps not daring
to anger Roman, they promised to assemble and examine his project. Later on, in one
way and another, they avoided the meeting. Big Nest refused to consider the question
at all, and answered: “I have no wish to violate customs. Let matters rest as they
were in the days of our fathers.”
</p>
<p>Involved more and more with his Polish relations, Roman did not cease to help Leshko
in the war which he waged against Mechislav, his uncle. He took part in a later war,
also, against Mechislav’s son, surnamed Cane Legs (Laska Nogi). Meanwhile, regiments
of Volynia and Galitch occupied the ancient Russian region of Lublin. But Leshko and
Cane Legs made peace with each other, and asked Roman to lead home his warriors. Roman,
in answer, laid siege to Lublin and demanded either a return in money for all his
campaign, or that they should yield up to him this ancient Russian region so long
in dispute between Poles and Russians.
</p>
<p>Leshko, roused against Roman by Cane Legs, marched with Konrad, his brother, to attack
him. Roman abandoned the siege and went to meet the two brothers. When he was encamped
on the left of the Vistula, at Zavihvost, envoys came to him from Leshko, and a truce
was agreed upon, pending a final arrangement and treaty. Supposing this truce to be
genuine, Roman, taking no further thought about action or safety, went out one day
from his camp to hunt with a small party. All at once he was surrounded, and, in a
desperate struggle with men who would not take note of the truce, he fell, weapons
in hand, with all his attendants. This was in 1205, on the day of Saints Gervasius
and Protasius.
</p>
<p>Leshko and his brother were so rejoiced at the unhoped-for deliverance, that in the
Cracow cathedral they raised an altar to those two saints and made them their patrons.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">PRINCE OF HUNGARY MADE KING OF GALITCH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Roman’s death became known, Chermny, Prince of Chernigoff, set out for Kief.
But the monk Rurik was in the city before him. Throwing off his habit, he ruled again
in the ancient capital, replacing Rostislav, who left the throne to his father. Rurik
and his allies, bound by old treaties, took fresh oaths, Rurik agreeing to give them
certain towns near the capital, Bailgorod on the Ros, Torchesk, and Tropoli.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Galitch there were disturbances, quarrels and uprisings. There was no
end to dissensions among boyars, who rushed in from all sides, returning some from
Hungary, and others from Poland. Roman’s former enemies tried to arm all men against
the heirs of their late opponent. The youthful widow of Roman was left with two sons,
Daniel, four years of age, and Vassilko, an infant. Though in 1205 the people of Galitch
had proclaimed Daniel to be their prince, and had taken oath to him, it was impossible
for a little boy, or those who had charge of him, to keep peace among quarreling factions
which were threatening one another with bloodshed. At this difficult juncture, the
widow sought audience of Andrei of Hungary, who had just received the Hungarian crown
so long withheld from him. This was the same Andrei who had once ruled in Galitch,
but had become afterward a friend of Roman. He was moved now by her grief as she presented
Roman’s orphans, and he remembered the promise which on a time he had given their
father. Loyal to his brother by adoption, as he called Roman, who was a distant relative,
Andrei’s grandfather, Geiza, having married Efrosina, daughter of Mystislav the Great,
and sister of Roman’s grandfather, Andrei fondled Daniel, called him “dear son,” and
sent a detachment of warriors to establish him in Galitch and guard the peace there.
Hungarian garrisons were <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>distributed also in many places. This timely aid, though foreign, stopped attack from
Kief and Chernigoff princes, who fought on the Dniester and Seret successfully, but
dared not draw near Galitch.
</p>
<p>This evidence of friendship on the part of the king forestalled action by the boyars
of Galitch. But the year following, 1206, Chermny again led his men into Galitch,
bringing with him a great force of Polovtsi. All the sons of the late Igor of Novgorod-Seversk
joined him, and also the grandsons of Yaroslav, who, through their mother, the daughter
of Eight Minds, thought themselves the next heirs to Galitch. Chermny also engaged
the Mazovian princes, who were hostile to Galitch. Though connected with these princes
by marriage, for his wife was the daughter of Kazimir, he relied less on their friendship
for him than on their jealousy of Hungary. He believed that the Poles and Hungarians
would dispute over Galitch, and he was not mistaken. Rurik also, as Kief prince, thought
himself master of every inheritance. This time the allies were more numerous than
a year earlier.
</p>
<p>At news of this advance of Russian princes and of their alliance with Poles, a disturbance
began which was worse than any preceeding it. The enemies of Roman’s sons preferred
Chernigoff princes. Some of the boyars wished neither Daniel nor any grandson of Eight
Minds, but Hungary, with which they desired perfect union. Others inclined toward
the Poles; still others declared that they wished no prince whatever, that they were
all foreign upstarts; that a government by boyars was the right one for Galitch. To
this party were joined men who had deserted the people, adventurers of all kinds.
These disposers of Galitch were willing to attach themselves to any faction, to leave
any side for any other. They were ready to flatter all parties at once, if by thus
doing they could continue disorder. The seizure of lands and the winning of fortunes
was their single policy. The tyranny of boyars increased daily. The grabbing of land
had become now an everyday action, and men who were not boyars at all, but laid claim
to the title, took lands and kept them.
</p>
<p>Roman’s sons were surrounded by falsehood and treason. When they heard that Polish
and Russian forces were marching against them, they turned to their protector. But
to wait for the king would have been perilous. He gave notice indeed that he was coming
and would save them, but Galitch disorders had <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>become so serious that the widowed princess refused to stay longer in the city with
her children; and the family of Roman saved itself only by flight to Volynia. When
the king had passed the mountains, he heard that the Poles were marching on Volynia,
and he hastened to intercept them.
</p>
<p>Igor’s sons crossed the Galitch boundary, but halted when they found that the king
was leading in a strong army. At this juncture, affairs suddenly called Andrei back
to Hungary. Such disturbances had broken out there that he feared for his throne.
In view of this, he sought peace with the Poles, pointing out to them that he did
not seek Galitch for himself, and did not insist now on setting up Roman’s children.
He advised Galitch men to invite Yaroslav, son of Big Nest, to be their prince.
</p>
<p>Abandoned by Andrei and all the Hungarians, the men of Galitch were terrified by the
advance of Rurik and the Chernigoff forces. Yaroslav was hastening to them from Pereyaslavl,
but the sons of Igor anticipated him, for they were present in the Chernigoff army.
Owing to the ancient ties between <span class="corr" id="xd32e1647" title="Source: Novgorod-Senersk">Novgorod-Seversk</span> and the family of Eight Minds, but, more than that, owing to the triumph at that
juncture of those boyars who preferred the sons of Igor to all other princes, they
established themselves in Galitch. Such a quick turn toward Oleg’s descendants put
an end to the whole expedition.
</p>
<p>Chermny, satisfied with the success of his line, withdrew from his connection with
Rurik and the quarreling allies returned to their homes. But it was not enough that
the sons of Igor were in Galitch. The boyars who had seated them did not wish to lose
Volynia, and commanded these princes, who were now in their power, to get possession
of that city, and expel the sons of Roman. The sons of Igor immediately sent envoys
to Volynia to demand the surrender of the city. The people were so enraged by this
demand that they wished to tear the envoys to pieces. But in Volynia, too, there were
boyars who sided with the sons of Igor, hence the disposition of the capital was mutinous.
The widowed princess, on learning that the sons of Igor had threatened to destroy
Volynia if Roman’s sons, Daniel and Vassilko, were not given up to them, and that
the city contained not a few partisans of those princes, counseled with Miroslav,
her elder son’s tutor, and resolved to flee promptly.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p>Avoiding the city gates, where the guards might be hostile, the princess crept through
a hole in the wall during night hours. With her were three persons, Miroslav, a priest,
and a nurse who cared for the little princes. “Not knowing to what place they should
flee,” adds the chronicler, “since the Poles had murdered Roman.” But being related
to Leshko, the widow decided to appear before him, and ask refuge. Leshko was moved
when he saw the little orphans of the man who had been both his friend and opponent.
“The devil himself made us disagree in those days,” cried he. Leshko had in fact loved
Roman; but the crafty Cane Legs, for purposes of his own, had brought about the quarrel.
</p>
<p>Leshko kept the princess with her infant Vassilko, and sent Daniel with attendants
to Hungary, commanding his envoys to say to the king there: “Remember not the faults
of Roman, for he was a friend to thee. He and thou swore to each other that whoso
of you lived the longer would cherish the orphans of the dead man. Now Roman’s children
are exiles, but thou and I may help them to return to their country.” These words,
flattering, through confidence, served to bring the prince and the Hungarian king
nearer to each other. Hitherto they had been quarreling, but thenceforth both men
cared actively for the two sons of Roman. This care was friendly in appearance, but
fatal in reality. These men had now an opportunity to reëstablish the strong house
of Roman, but fearing its power, they hesitated to do so. For them there was profit
in separating Galitch from Volynia, and more profit still in taking possession of
those lands and dividing them. Hence throughout Galitch and Volynia endless disorder
continued.
</p>
<p>In Kief troubles multiplied immensely, because Big Nest did not choose to put an end
to them. He left Southern Russia to follow its own course. But great changes were
at hand. Chermny, seeing that matters had arranged themselves well to his profit in
Galitch without Rurik’s devices, and that Rurik had not power to bestow on Chernigoff
the Kief cities promised it, quarreled with him finally, and, relying on himself,
seized Kief. “Why should I not take it?” thought he. “I am Sviatoslav’s heir.”
</p>
<p>Once in Kief, Chermny sent these words to Yaroslav, Prince of Pereyaslavl on the Alta:
“Go to thy father, and seek not to take Galitch from my cousins. Unless thou leave
of thy own will, I will march against thee.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>Pereyaslavl was vacated immediately, and Chermny installed a prince of his own line.
Rurik, enraged by this, summoned Mystislav, the Smolensk prince, Mystislav the Gallant,
and his own sons, Vladimir and Rostislav, to help him, and, aided by their forces,
he drove Chermny out of Kief, and won back Pereyaslavl. The following winter Chermny,
as was his wont, led into the country great hordes of Polovtsi, and laid siege to
Kief, but was soon forced to raise the siege and withdraw. At the end of the year
he returned with larger forces, and began by winning Tripoli on the Ros. Vladimir,
son of Igor, came with assistance, and all marched on Kief. Rurik, learning that enormous
forces were moving against him from every side, and knowing that there was no aid
from any place, withdrew to Ovrutch. Chermny, besides seizing Kief, took Bailgorod,
and reduced Torchesk by famine. Thus at the end of 1207 all the Kief country fell
into his possession.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Galitch and Volynia, affairs were very gloomy. At first the Hungarian
king, taking pity on Daniel, wished to give him the dominions of his father, but the
sons of Igor sent costly gifts to Andrei, and ceased not in the sending, declaring
at the same time that they were ready to remain as his assistants. This was the position
which the boyars desired. Such subjection of Galitch pleased the king, who kept Daniel
near him, as if through hospitality. Leshko, by sheltering Vassilko and his mother,
under pretext of defending the orphans and restoring their inheritance, managed in
Volynia as he did in his own house. At this work he was helped most zealously by Alexander,
better known as Bailski, Roman’s nephew, his brother’s son, who wished to rule in
Volynia, and set aside Roman’s sons if possible. So the sons of Igor were protected
by the King of Hungary, and Bailski worked with Leshko to keep Volynia from the sons
of Roman. Thanks to Bailski, Leshko, and Konrad his brother, brought Polish forces
to Volynia and disposed of places in it, as if they were their own inherited possessions.
Some they gave to Russian princes who pleased them; others they reserved for their
own special use. The people of Volynia, indignant at this Polish action, passed judgment
on Bailski “the traitor,” saying; “We trusted Bailski, since he was Roman’s nephew.
Had it not been for that, the Poles could never have crossed the Būg to rob us.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Polish princes kept Bailski in Volynia, as the manager. Leshko married Gremislav,
Bailski’s daughter, and the former connection of Mazovian princes with the princes
of Volynia became even more involved through this marriage, which gave them, as they
thought, still greater right to use Volynia as their own inheritance.
</p>
<p>But soon the senior of Volynian princes, that same Ingvar who in Roman’s day had reigned
in Kief, though very briefly, claimed Volynia, and was established in it, though for
a short period only. The Polish guardians changed their minds quickly. The place returned
to Bailski, and Ingvar was sent back to Lutsk.
</p>
<p>To Vassilko, Roman’s second son, his Polish guardians gave Brest at the urgent demand
of its people, who, alarmed that Poles had taken possession of Russian land so near
them, wished to have their native princes. When the mother went to Brest with Vassilko,
the people met her with joy, and declared that in the boy they beheld the great Roman.
The widow complained with bitterness: “They have given Bailski all our lands; only
one town is left for my son.” In view of this complaint Leshko, who had given much
to Bailski, commanded him to yield Bailz to Daniel and his brother.
</p>
<p>Sviatoslav, son of Igor, once captured in Volynia, was sent to his brothers in Galitch,
neither to his own good nor theirs, as became evident later. In Galitch the boyars
made prince quarrel with prince, and brother rise against brother. Each son of Igor
wished to take all that his brothers had, each wished to rise at the expense of the
others; each of them fled more than once from his portion, and returned to it eagerly.
More than once was complaint made in Hungary against all three of them. The king wished
at last to be rid of these quarrelsome princes, so he placed in Galitch his own viceroy,
Benedict Bor, a noted magnate, to whom he gave great authority.
</p>
<p>Big Nest, Prince of Vladimir, now suddenly decided to cast aside his policy of non-interference
and take active part in Southern Russia. When his son Yaroslav, driven from Pereyaslavl,
returned home and described Chermny’s accession, and the general predominance of Oleg’s
descendants, even in Galitch, Big Nest inquired: “Is all that land theirs, or is it
ours as well?” And these words of the Grand Prince went whirling through Russia. <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>They encouraged the descendants of Monomach and confused the Chernigoff princes. A
great army soon moved from the North toward the South. Command was given to the troops
of Ladoga, of Pskoff, of Nova-Torg and Tver to march with it. All these forces were
led by Constantine, the eldest son of the Prince of Vladimir, who waited for his father
at Moscow. Big Nest advanced with the men of Rostoff and Suzdal and the Vladimir regiments,
led by his second and third sons, Yuri and Yaroslav; with him also was Vladimir, his
youngest son. The troops of Pronsk, Ryazan and <span class="corr" id="xd32e1672" title="Source: Nurom">Murom</span> had received commands to join the expedition at Moscow.
</p>
<p>In Moscow the two main divisions met. The Grand Prince gave a week for rest. He praised
the posadnik of Novgorod and the boyars of that city for obedience, and gave a great
feast to them. In general, the Moscow halt was gladsome for the warriors. From Moscow
they went to the Oká, where, in the meadows opposite the Chernigoff-Ryazan bank, they
pitched their camp. There they were soon joined by the remaining forces, but still
they did not advance. This caused general surprise in the army, and men began to complain
of delay and indecision.
</p>
<p>It was said that Big Nest’s eldest son, Constantine, had quarreled with his father
over this question. It was also stated that there was treachery in the army, that
two princes of Ryazan, Roman and Sviatoslav, sons of Glaib, had betrayed their uncle
and cousins, and had promised to go over to Chermny’s side and deliver Big Nest into
his hands. It seems true that Ryazan princes had been brought into this campaign against
their wishes, that they did not desire success for Big Nest, and in case of his failure
would have gone over, in all likelihood, to his opponents.
</p>
<p>The cautious Prince of Vladimir acted in his own way. He sent to his capital as prisoners
all the princes who had come to him from Ryazan, and all their boyars, with command
to keep them carefully under guard. Then he turned toward Ryazan. First he attacked
Pronsk, which after desperate resistance surrendered. He then appointed his own men
to places throughout the principality, and moved on Ryazan. He was within twenty versts
of that city and about to pass the Pron River, when a large company of penitent Ryazan
men came, bringing with them envoys <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>from the bishop. They bowed down and humbly implored the Vladimir prince not to ruin
their city. Arseni, the Ryazan bishop, had sent more than once remonstrating letters,
and now he spoke through envoys: “Grand Prince and lord, do not ruin noble places.
Do not burn God’s holy churches; sacrifice is offered to the Lord in them, and prayers
for thee. We promise to accomplish thy will as thou wishest precisely.”
</p>
<p>Big Nest, pleased with this obedience, turned his anger into mercy. He ordered the
army to withdraw to Kolomna, where the petitioners were to meet him for final negotiations.
It was late in the year, inclining to frost. The Oká was not firmly frozen, but there
was ice on it. Big Nest had to wait two days in tents near the river; the third day
heavy frost came; the whole army crossed the Oká on the ice, and entered Kolomna.
The night after a tremendous storm rose; next morning came a violent rainfall, and
the ice broke. The bishop, Arseni, and the Ryazan men crossed in boats, with great
peril. The bishop thanked the Grand Prince for his clemency, and begged him to be
gracious to the end, to return the captured princes, and he, the bishop, would answer
for their loyalty.
</p>
<p>“Cast aside thy anger against those men,” said he; “take them into thy favor and the
Most Holy will cast aside thy faults. Turn thy ear from calumniators, for they, with
feigned loyalty and fawning, are working not for the good of the country, but for
their own profit. God has placed thee, O great prince, as a ruler to judge and give
justice to His people. It is proper for thee to punish the guilty, God himself commands
thee to do so, but there is need also for mercy, and not of punishment in anger. I,
thy lowly petitioner, have been sent to thee at the prayer of all the Ryazan men.
I have not come with power to command, that is not given from God to me, but with
mildness and tears I implore and pray thee to accept my beseeching.”
</p>
<p>Big Nest was moved by these speeches, and declared to the bishop, that because of
his pastoral intercession, and the penitence of the Ryazan men, he was willing to
give complete peace, if they would promise not to conspire against him or oppose him
in future. The bishop took this promise on himself, and engaged to bind the whole
people to it by an oath. Big Nest agreed to think of the captive princes, but later
on,—not that day. In this, however, <span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>he did not yield to the prayers of Arseni, offered in the name of Ryazan. On the contrary,
he demanded that they should without delay send the remaining princes and princesses
to him in Vladimir, so that there should be no further disturbance.
</p>
<p>November 21, 1207, the army arrived in Vladimir, and there was great rejoicing. Big
Nest again thanked and rewarded the Pskoff and Novgorod men, who had shared the campaign
and its toils with him. Especially was he kind to the wounded, many of whom he retained
in Vladimir at his own expense till they recovered.
</p>
<p>The Ryazan men, when the bishop returned to them, listened to the tidings which he
brought, and took counsel. They did not find it possible to disobey the Grand Prince;
so they sent the rest of their princes and princesses to Vladimir. Such a quick and
complete accomplishment of his will was a surprise even to Big Nest. He explained
it only by this, that the bishop, who was dependent on him, not on Chernigoff, brought
them to submission.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1208, Big Nest sent as prince to Ryazan his son Yaroslav, who had
been driven from Pereyaslavl by Rurik. The Ryazan men, not without astonishment, but
without resistance, accepted the prince and kissed the cross to him, and there was
no special dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>But the bishop’s statement when he spoke of calumniators, who feigned loyalty and
only sought their own objects, proved true somewhat later. Glaib, who at the beginning
of the campaign against Chernigoff had informed the Prince of Vladimir of the disloyalty
of Ryazan men, had no doubt that after such service he would be made prince in Ryazan.
Now, when he was put aside, he began to intrigue in all places. He could not be detected
in open treason, but secretly he worked with untiring energy to increase discontent.
He roused “the thought of disorder and the spirit of pride,” which in Ryazan displeased
the Grand Prince so greatly. The name of Glaib was used now among the people as the
watchword of liberty. In him they saw the defender of Ryazan, the hero of their freedom.
Danger threatened the son of Big Nest. Many of his lieutenants were driven from their
places; some were confined in cellars, others were put in chains, and some died of
hunger. There were uprisings throughout the <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>whole principality, and all things indicated that a general revolt was beginning.
</p>
<p>Big Nest saw that he had been deceived by the Ryazan men, and that he had congratulated
himself too soon. He was indignant, and, determining that neither they nor their bishop
should deceive him a second time, he led a new attack on Ryazan. When he was approaching
the doomed capital his son, Yaroslav, came to meet him, thinking to incline him toward
mercy. Shielding the guilty as far as was possible, he assured his father of the general
obedience, and brought forward many men to strengthen this statement. But excuses
and speeches seemed insolent to Big Nest; he paid no heed to any statement. Commanding
the people to leave the city immediately, and take all movable property with them,
he sent warriors to fire the place. From Ryazan he marched to Bailgorod, and the same
cruel fate met that city. The whole Ryazan region was turned into emptiness by Vsevolod,
Grand Prince of Vladimir.
</p>
<p>During this campaign multitudes of proud, unbending men were seized in various Ryazan
towns and sent with their families to Vladimir to be settled afterward in remote places.
Big Nest took the most notable boyars to Vladimir, also the bishop. Of the princes
who survived this visitation, only two tried to struggle further. Izyaslav, the only
one of Glaib’s sons who had abstained from intrigue, and had distinguished himself
by gallant fighting at Pronsk, and Kir Michael, who had sought refuge with Chermny,
his father-in-law, and returned to reign afterward amid the ashes and ruins of his
birthplace.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1209–1210, these two princes, in revenge for the burning of the Ryazan,
attacked the southwestern edge of the Vladimir principality and burned many villages
near Moscow. Big Nest sent his son, Yuri, who expelled the two princes easily. He
severely punished Izyaslav’s forces, but Kir Michael escaped without injury. In 1210–1211,
attacks were made on Ryazan, but with decreased vigor. Big Nest did not go himself;
he sent his sword-bearer. This time also many prisoners were brought from Ryazan,
and settled at various points in Vladimir. Thus ended the war with Ryazan. Roman and
Sviatoslav never again saw their birthplace; both died in Vladimir. The younger princes
were freed, but only after the death of Big Nest.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the two years which Big Nest spent in warring with Ryazan, disturbances in the
South grew more and more intricate. There was war between Chermny and Rurik. Meanwhile
disorder in Galitch and Volynia increased continually. In Galitch, after the expulsion
of the sons of Igor, nothing was gained by the coming of Benedict Bor. That overbearing
viavoda, or viceroy, was dissolute and addicted to women; he ruled in a conquered
country and demanded from boyars and common men unlimited submission. His one care
was for feasts and orgies. Following the custom of Hungarian magnates of that day,
not only was he not ashamed of his vicious life,—he was proud of it. He seized maidens
and other men’s wives when it pleased him; priests’ wives and nuns were his preference.
It was said among the people that he did not govern, he harassed the country. Later
on he received the appellation “Antichrist.”
</p>
<p>Men demanded at last that they should be freed from this depraved viceroy. The people
of Galitch began to communicate in secret with the sons of Igor, and with neighboring
princes. At last they appealed to Mystislav the Silent, Prince of Peresopnitsa. This
inconsiderable prince, the youngest son of Lutsk, brother of Ingvar, imagining himself
the liberator of Galitch, came as a champion against “Antichrist,” but he appeared
without troops. His attendants were “so few that bystanders could count them.” The
boyars laughed him to scorn. More fortunate were his rivals, the sons of Igor, who
heard these words from Galitch, through an embassy sent to them: “We have sinned against
you, but come to us and save us from torture and ‘the harrier.’ ”
</p>
<p>Taught by experience, the brothers now made a treaty with one another. They promised
to have no more disputes, to take no land from one another, to ask nothing of the
King of Hungary, and with common forces to support one another and guard well the
country which they had lost and to which they were now summoned. When Benedict Bor
came to Galitch, he had seized in a bath their eldest brother, Vladimir. Now they
came near taking Bor in exactly the same condition. They entered the city so unexpectedly
and surprised the viceroy so thoroughly that “Antichrist” did not dream of resistance.
He thought only to save himself, and rushed in disgrace back to Hungary.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>Igor’s sons began to rule with great sternness. The king held them as rebels and disturbers;
the boyars looked on them as outlaws and as rebels against boyar lordship; but the
princes gave no ear to those boyars, showing a contempt which was calculated and unsparing.
They hunted boyars and put them to death without mercy; they put magnates to death
for the least opposition, and brought back the stern days of Roman. Against boyars
a council was created which put to death Yuri Vassilievitch, Ilya Stepanovitch, and
other distinguished men. Five hundred in all lost their lives. Many fled from Galitch.
Even Volodislav, that boyar who first brought Galitch people to favor Igor’s sons
during their boyhood, when their mother, the daughter of Eight Minds, was living,
was forced to seek safety in flight, and from being their ally, he now became their
worst enemy. With him went Sudislav and Philip, celebrated boyars, and other men like
them. These swore on leaving the country that they would return and show who they
were to those fellows who had dared to ape Roman.
</p>
<p>The rage of those men against Igor’s sons was not to be measured. Volodislav toiled
now in Hungary, saying: “Igor’s sons, in clear violation of regal right, and in hostility
to the will of their monarch, are ruling as despots.” Volodislav implored Andrei to
give him an army and Daniel, then ten years of age, to go with him. “I will bring
Galitch to the feet of your Majesty promptly,” said he.
</p>
<p>The king wished in one way or another to establish Roman’s heir, whom he was guarding.
There were reports that he thought of giving Daniel his daughter, and with her Galitch
as dowry. Volodislav’s words pleased the king; he gave a trusty following, and sent
with the boyar his so-called son, Daniel.
</p>
<p>The first towns, Peremysl and Zvenigorod, were hostile; neither place yielded. Daniel
was shown to the people, and they were advised to take the prince born to them, but
they clung to Igor’s sons firmly. They saw the king’s banners before them, they heard
that voevodas and horsemen had come in large number from Hungary,—still they would
not surrender. In Peremysl, they stood resolutely for Sviatoslav, that son of Igor
who was with them. Then Volodislav himself went up to the walls of the city and called
to the people: “Oh, brothers, why do ye waver? Are the men now managing our country
not foreign intruders? Did they not slay <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>both your fathers and brothers and bear off your property? Did they not give your
daughters to their servants? Do ye wish to lay down your lives for them?” The people
listened to these questions, and remembered the evil done in the first reign of Igor’s
sons. They hesitated also to dip their hands in blood in a war against Daniel, so
at last they opened the gates of the city to him. Igor’s son, Sviatoslav, was captured.
</p>
<p>At Zvenigorod the people fought stubbornly. The besieged did not let Volodislav come
near the walls, and they made desperate sallies. The prince in that city was Roman,
son of Igor, who brought “wild Polovtsi” to help him. Mika, Andrei’s voevoda, was
unable to save himself. The “wild ones” took the head from his shoulders. That day
the Hungarians were badly defeated.
</p>
<p>When the Volynia men heard that “their Daniel” had come, they rose up against the
sons of Igor. In Volynia all “the people” favored Daniel and his brother.
</p>
<p>Envious, since Galitch was becoming the property of Hungary, Leshko, the guardian
of Vassilko, took part in the uprising also. The Poles hastened to war against Hungary.
Ingvar of Lutsk went with them, while Vassilko sent men from Bailz to his brother.
It was difficult for Zvenigorod to remain independent. Roman, son of Igor, fearing
the fate of his brother, declared that he was going for assistance, but he was captured
and taken to the camp of the enemy. Then the allies sent this message to the citizens:
“Your prince is captured! Surrender!” They could not believe it, and continued to
fight for him, but when they saw Roman a captive they yielded. The eldest brother,
Vladimir, who was in Galitch, left the city as the enemy approached it, and sought
safety in flight. He was pursued and came near being captured, but his swift-footed
stallion saved him.
</p>
<p>Thus was accomplished in Galitch what Roman’s widow, tortured by waiting and exile,
had not dared even to hope for; her firstborn son, Daniel, entered Galitch in triumph,
and occupied the throne of his father. She appeared now in Galitch very promptly.
Daniel, the boy of ten years, did not know her, but, as the annalist tells us, he
expressed all the more feeling when he heard the word “son” from her lips, and saw
the tears of delight which fell from her eyes. The boyars did not want that strong-hearted
<span class="pageNum" id="pb174">[<a href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>mother in the country, for her word might have power there against them, hence she
was removed quickly and without ceremony. Daniel was frantic at the parting. The boy
had no wish to be in Galitch without his mother, and, while her foes were conducting
her out of the city, he rode at her side, and held her robes firmly. One of the boyars
seized the bridle of his horse to stop him. Furious at this, the young prince gave
a sword-blow which missed the boyar, but wounded the horse on which he was riding.
The mother grasped Daniel’s sword-hilt, bidding him to be calm and stay bravely in
Galitch. On returning to Bailz, she sent a message to Hungary, complaining bitterly
of the boyars, of Sudislav, and of Philip, but, above all, of Volodislav.
</p>
<p>The boyars had not got what they wanted. They had overthrown Igor’s sons, who had
dared to remind them of Roman, but to overthrow those princes was not enough; they
must punish them. Such men as Sudislav and Volodislav were ready to give immense sums
in gold for opponents like Sviatoslav and Roman. The voevodas, however, refused to
yield up the captives, saying that such traitors should be sent to the sovereign.
The boyars now had recourse to gold, and the voevodas, persuaded by great gifts, agreed
to surrender the princes. In this way the men got possession of Igor’s sons and then
hanged them. While the princes were swinging on gibbets, those boyars pierced them
with arrows shot from their own bows by their own hands. That done they gave homage
to Daniel, placed on the throne by the King of Hungary, and went home in good humor.
Galitch was governed by boyars.
</p>
<p>That same year, 1211, the king, touched by the tears of Roman’s widow, went in person
to establish her in Galitch, where, to his amazement, he found Daniel’s relatives
from Volynia,—Ingvar of Lutsk and others, who were there under pretext of visiting
the new prince.
</p>
<p>The king acted quickly. Volodislav, with Sudislav and Philip, were placed under guard,
and then tortured; after this they were exiled. Sudislav, however, bought his freedom.
“He turned himself into gold,” as is said by the chronicler. Volodislav was sent to
Hungary in fetters, but he had two brothers in freedom, who were precisely such wily
heroes as Volodislav himself. These men appeared now before Mystislav, whose brother,
Ingvar, had <span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span>not been in Galitch without a purpose. All Volynia rose in revolt quickly, and made
war on Andrei. Volynia was managed at this time by Leshko of Poland. This guardian
of Vassilko had taken Bailz from his ward and given it back to Bailski, his father-in-law.
The little Vassilko had been forced to hide himself in the poor town of Kamenyets.
No one knew well, save the managers, what was happening in Volynia. To the outward
observer there was chaos everywhere. In Galitch confusion seemed dominant. Reports
were brought in that countless regiments were moving against the city. The people
were ready to surrender, and go out and join with those regiments. Daniel and his
mother, whom the king had brought back, fled now to save themselves, and Mystislav
the Silent, who had been brought by Volodislav’s brothers, entered the city in triumph.
</p>
<p>After this incredible triumph of Mystislav, came the still more incredible triumph
of the chief of these brothers, Volodislav. From fetters and a prison in Hungary,
he appeared before the king in his palace, and was nearer to power than he had ever
been. A report flew through the country that the king was disposed to give him the
throne of Galitch, and in fact not much time passed before Volodislav, at the head
of Hungarians and a mercenary army, broke into Galitch.
</p>
<p>Mystislav the Silent, whose rule had been short-lived, left his capital, and vanished.
His place was immediately occupied by Volodislav. The chronicler says that he took
the throne and ruled Galitch. All this was incredible only in appearance, for everything
took place in the simplest manner possible.
</p>
<p>The Poles and Hungarians, who were guarding the persons, and also the inheritance
of Daniel and Vassilko, vied with each other in turning this inheritance to their
own use and profit. Neither lacked will in the matter; means alone failed them. The
determination of Hungarians equaled that of the Poles, but their absence of means
was equal also. The Poles tried to win by bringing forward their kinship in Russia.
The Hungarians worked in another way. They promised to give the boyars of Galitch
a constitution like that in Hungary. They agreed to deliver the whole land and the
people to those boyars.
</p>
<p>Volodislav’s aims were clear and consistent. A year earlier, he had promised the submission
of Galitch; he had guaranteed <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>to snatch the whole land from Igor’s sons and return it to Hungary. This he had done,
and the king might have placed there as viceroy any boyar whom he liked, but to have
Daniel thrust upon this party of magnates was unendurable. Volodislav had fulfilled
his promise, and now he explained to Andrei that Galitch did not want a Russian prince;
it wanted to be governed by boyars associated intimately with Hungary. This time Volodislav
assured the king of a satisfactory agreement. Thus the solid union of Galitch with
Hungary seemed imminent.
</p>
<p>Andrei sent Volodislav forward with associates to bring all things to order, while
he, with his main army, followed. He was on the Russian slope of the mountains when
news overtook him of a terrible outburst in Hungary, not simply in the kingdom, but
in his own palace.
</p>
<p>Andrei had been forced to yield more than any preceding king, to do more toward lessening
royal power and building up nobles. Gertrude, his queen, was ambitious. A German princess,
she had filled Hungary with her relatives and with Germans in general. She had urged
Andrei to cruelties, and in retaliation attacks upon Hungarians were increasing. The
queen helped her relatives and countrymen to wealth and high places. She was fond
also of aiding in love intrigues. Eckbert, her brother, became enamoured of the wife
of Benedict Bor, the man known in Galitch as Antichrist. The queen permitted the lovers
to meet in the palace, even in one of her own chambers. Though Bor was notorious for
absence of morals, and was in the habit of seizing other men’s wives if they pleased
him, he could not pardon the queen, when her love intrigues involved his own family.
The king being absent, Bor joined with other avengers, and slew a great number of
Germans. Queen Gertrude was cut into pieces, and the whole palace was plundered. This
was the news brought to Andrei in the mountains.
</p>
<p>He returned to his capital by forced marches, and quelled the savage outburst with
great bloodshed.
</p>
<p>Volodislav, sent in advance of the king to take possession of Galitch, acted like
a man clothed in majesty. No matter how far-reaching were his powers, he increased
them, since the king was not present.
</p>
<p>When Andrei had put down the uprising and freed himself <span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>somewhat in Hungary, he hurried off to make war on Leshko for his ravages in Galitch,
which the king looked on as his own spoil and property. Leshko, besides guarding Vassilko,
had taken on himself the care of Daniel. For the sake of these orphans, as he declared,
he was ready to fight for Galitch as well as Volynia. Daniel, on seeing the terrible
bloodshed in Hungary when Queen Gertrude was murdered, withdrew thence to Poland,
where he got naught from Leshko but a reception with honor; later he went to Kamenyets,
where his brother was living. There, still more than in Bailz, was Vassilko attended
by the ancient adherents of Roman, his father. Daniel, who was of an age now to ride
a horse splendidly, joined them, and Roman’s boyars rallied round the brothers with
enthusiasm. Leshko could not hide his astonishment on seeing that after Bailz had
been taken from Vassilko not one of those faithful adherents abandoned the orphans,
and when a whole court gathered round them in Kamenyets, he was still more disquieted.
“Thenceforward, Leshko felt great affection for Daniel.”
</p>
<p>Volynia rose now against Volodislav. First Mystislav the Silent was put forward, then
Bailski, Leshko’s father-in-law, sent his brother, Vsevolod, to attack the adventurer,
and went himself later. Last of all Daniel acted. After that, Leshko with Poles and
men of Volynia advanced against Volodislav. Volodislav left to his brothers the task
of defending the capital, and with hired forces hurried forth to meet his opponents,
but he was driven back and defeated. The victors could not take Galitch, however.
They fought at its walls till exhausted, and then had to abandon the task. On the
way home, Leshko induced Bailski, now Prince of Volynia, to give two towns near the
capital to the orphans, who then moved thither from Kamenyets, and, being near the
capital, ceased not to sigh for it. “It will come to us,” thought they. And it came
earlier than they expected.
</p>
<p>Not Leshko, but his voevoda, Pakoslav, keen at invention, found means to reconcile
warring interests for the moment. Leshko had a young daughter and Andrei of Hungary
had a son. Leshko sent Pakoslav to the king with this message: “Volodislav, a boyar,
should not be on a throne. Take thou my Saloméya for thy Koloman, and let us <span class="corr" id="xd32e1746" title="Source: instal">install</span> them in Galitch.” Pakoslav’s plan pleased Andrei. He had a meeting with Leshko, and
they <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>arranged all the details of the marriage. The king, from the portion of Koloman, gave
two cities to Pakoslav,—Peremysl and Lubetch.
</p>
<p>Pakoslav now offered a second good counsel: “Let the prince, out of love for the orphans,
give them Vladimir of Volynia.” Immediately Leshko sent this message to Bailski: “Give
Vladimir to Vassilko and Daniel. If thou wilt not consent, I will take it.” Bailski
would not yield, then Leshko constrained him, and <span class="corr" id="xd32e1753" title="Source: instaled">installed</span> Roman’s sons in Vladimir.
</p>
<p>Volodislav, now a prisoner, was put in fetters and died in confinement. No prince
would shelter his orphans, because their father had aspired to sovereignty.
</p>
<p>The King and Queen of Galitch, though mere children, were crowned straightway. Andrei,
seeing that the boyars were desirous of union with Hungary, and remembering their
statement that the people would not oppose union, if their faith and its ceremonies
were respected, now wrote to the Pope on the subject: “Let it be known to your Holiness
that the princes of Galicia, and the people there under us, wish as king our son,
Koloman, and promise union with the Most Holy Roman Church if they may keep their
own ritual. Lest delay harm a thing so useful to us and to you, give a written command,
we beg of you, to the Archbishop of Strigonia to anoint, at the earliest, our son,
the King of Galitch.”
</p>
<p>In the Russian chronicles it is written under the year 1214: “The Ugrian king seated
his son in Galitch; he then drove out and hunted the clergy and bishops from the churches,
and brought in his own Latin priesthood.”
</p>
<p>Thus Galitch was lost for a time to Russian princes and the Orthodox clergy. In Chernigoff
and Kief, people were not thinking of Galitch; they had their own troubles. Chermny
and Rurik exchanged principalities, Chermny went to Kief and Rurik to Chernigoff.
Thus the ancient home of Oleg and his descendants passed to a descendant of Monomach,
and Chermny, the senior of Oleg’s descendants, not only took the old capital, but
threatened to drive from Kief regions all the descendants of Monomach. He declared
that through their fault a terrible crime had been committed. “Ye caused the death
of my cousins in Galitch, and put a great shame on us. Ye have no part in Kief regions,”
asserted he. Still after that Chermny turned to Big Nest with <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>a prayer for peace and friendship. He begged the metropolitan to bear this request
to Vladimir. Peace was granted, and that winter Big Nest strengthened this peace by
a marriage between his second son, Yuri, and the daughter of Chermny.
</p>
<p>Toward the end of his life, the Prince of Vladimir had many disputes with Novgorod,
which for years had been friendly. It was most important for Novgorod to be at peace
with Vladimir, to trade with its broad regions, and receive grain, which in Novgorod
was lacking at all times. Nothing harmed Novgorod more than a quarrel with Vladimir,
whose prince could stop grain from reaching the city and surrounding country, and
arrest Novgorod merchants wherever he found them in his own territory. But this was
not sufficient to change the quarrelsome disposition of Novgorod, where factions fought
with one another continually. When a posadnik displeased them, they beat him, or hurled
the man from the bridge to the river. Big Nest did not interfere with their freedom.
On the contrary he apparently commended it. “Love him who seems good to you, but execute
bad men,” said he. And the Novgorod people carried out this instruction, even against
their own adherents, the Miroshiniches, with whom they settled in real Novgorod fashion.
</p>
<p>Miroshka was chosen posadnik in 1187 to please Big Nest. He was the son of Naizda,
a man killed by them in the days of Andrei Bogolyubski, for adherence to Vladimir.
When Miroshka died his descendants became famous people. Big Nest was unable for a
long time to bring about the election, as posadnik, of Miroshka’s son, Dmitri. He
could not do so till he sent his own son, Constantine, as prince to the city. The
Novgorod men then cast out the old posadnik, and gave the office to Dmitri. This brought
about a conflict with a great citizen of Novgorod, Oleksa Bogolyubski Sbyslavich,
but he met his death very quickly.
</p>
<p>During Constantine’s stay in Novgorod, 1205–1209, with Dmitri as posadnik, it might
be said that Big Nest ruled Novgorod as pleased him. The execution of Oleksa is proof
of this. All were astounded when Big Nest sent this command: “Execute Oleksa without
trial!” That is, at the good judgment of Constantine. And though all men were roused,
and said on the day after the execution that the Mother of God had dropped tears for
Oleksa, the will of the prince was accomplished. After this Dmitri <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>became so strong in his office, and served the Grand Prince so zealously, that the
four years of Constantine’s rule passed in harmony.
</p>
<p>When Constantine was summoned by his father to the war in Ryazan, a large force from
Novgorod marched with him under command of Dmitri, who was greatly distinguished at
the taking of Pronsk. He was wounded severely and Big Nest detained him to be healed
in Vladimir, but he died. After his death the people in Novgorod seized all his family
property, plundered his house and the house of his father and burned them. They sold
the country places of the son and the father, and also their servants; they took possession
of their effects and divided them. The debts due the family were left to the prince.
Still the people were not satisfied; they insisted on punishment, and when Dmitri’s
body was brought from Vladimir, they wished to hurl it into the river. Mitrophan,
the archbishop, was barely able to stop them. When Big Nest sent his son, Sviatoslav,
to the city, the people kissed the cross in assembly not to admit any son of Dmitri
to Novgorod, and they gave his family to the prince for imprisonment. But, though
Sviatoslav received the sums due Dmitri, and through them got much wealth, he did
not obey Novgorod in this affair. Some of the family he sent under guard to Vladimir;
a few he permitted to stay unobserved in the city.
</p>
<p>As this uprising was directed against all adherents of Big Nest, the Novgorod people
did not escape punishment. Again he arrested Novgorod merchants and their goods throughout
the lands of Vladimir. Great inconvenience was felt by Novgorod people, and Oleksa’s
avengers spread complaints wherever they could against Big Nest, who, being then at
the height of his power and influence, had no effective opponents. It seemed as though
no man could refuse him obedience.
</p>
<p>But at this juncture a prince of the smallest region in Russia, Mystislav of Toropets,
son of Mystislav the Brave, had courage to challenge the greatness of Big Nest. On
hearing how Novgorod was treated, he offered himself to the city, a thing unheard
of till that day in Russia.
</p>
<p>In the first years of this reign, during troubles in Novgorod, Mystislav the Brave
had inflicted defeat upon Big Nest, and now, in 1210, a more unexpected rebuff was
delivered by the son of <span class="pageNum" id="pb181">[<a href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>that same prince, Mystislav the Gallant, who had grown up and strengthened in this
interval, and whose fame began with this challenge. Thus far this young prince had
appeared only in small actions, in the quarrels of Rurik, his uncle, and in two or
three raids on the Polovtsi, but on coming to Novgorod he began a brilliant career
as a hero and defender of justice, a protector of the weak and offended, and he so
towered above other princes that he soon had no equal. Later on, he reminded the world
of his father, for he made a triumphant campaign against the Chuds, and brought them
all to obedience from border to border of that country.
</p>
<p>His appearance in Novgorod astonished every one by its daring, and was crowned with
incredible victory. From his small, insignificant Toropets he came with a slender
but chosen army. At Torjok he seized Sviatoslav’s boyars and took possession of their
property; then he sent the following message to Novgorod: “I bow to Holy Sophia; to
the grave of my father, and to all men of Novgorod. I have heard of the violence done
by your princes, and I grieve for my inheritance. Do ye wish me to be prince in your
city?” The Novgorod men were delighted and sent for him. Sviatoslav they confined
in the bishop’s palace with all his attendants, to keep him till “Lord Novgorod” should
settle with his father.
</p>
<p>The Prince of Vladimir in anger sent against “The Gallant” a numerous army, with his
three elder sons at the head of it. But immediately after he hesitated. He now, as
on a time Dolgoruki, his father, had done, thought proper to say when he faced an
untamable enemy: “I am old, he is young in all the passions of this world. It is not
for me, near the end of existence, to be occupied with quarrels and bloodshed. I should
be patient.” And he sent envoys to Mystislav with this message: “Thou art my son;
I am thy father. Free Sviatoslav with his boyars, and return what thou hast taken.
The merchants and their goods will be liberated.”
</p>
<p>Mystislav did at once all that was asked of him, and Big Nest fulfilled his promise.
<span class="corr" id="xd32e1781" title="Source: Sviastoslav">Sviatoslav</span> returned to his father, and Mystislav entered Novgorod, rejoicing that he had passed
through great peril without bloodshed.
</p>
<p>Big Nest was nearing the end of his earthly existence. He had continued the task undertaken
by his father and his brother to <span class="pageNum" id="pb182">[<a href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>preserve and enlarge the principality of Vladimir. He had not worked for all Russia,
though he had tried to hold a share in the Russia outside of Vladimir. During his
rule, which was firm and at times even terrible, he not only preserved unimpaired,
but extended and strengthened Vladimir. He established the beginning of a state in
the North and fixed its central region. Earlier than Big Nest, not only in the time
of his father, but also in that of Andrei, his brother, Rostoff and Suzdal were remembered
as belonging to Novgorod. Men did not consider Vladimir or Moscow or any other place,
as that Great Russia which they were to obey, and to which they must gravitate. Before
Big Nest’s activity, Bailozersk and Galitch beyond the Volga, and other places, if
not claimed by Novgorod altogether, were claimed at least partially. Now the Dvina
country beyond the Volga had become so connected with Vladimir that all was reconstituted.
That broad region looked on itself as Great Russia, and all men began to regard it
in that light. Lord Novgorod itself was forced to count those lands as lost forever.
Neither Rostoff nor Suzdal, from the time of Big Nest, dared to think of their earlier
primacy, the memory of which became mingled with traditions of its ancient connection
with Novgorod. After Big Nest there could be no talk of separation from Vladimir,
for it became clear that not to Rostoff, or to Suzdal did that Great Russia gravitate,
but to Vladimir.
</p>
<p>As his father had left Rostoff and Suzdal to his younger sons and Vladimir to the
eldest, so Big Nest, almost on the eve of his death, gave Vladimir to his eldest son,
Constantine, and left Rostoff to Yuri his second son.
</p>
<p>Constantine, who was in Rostoff at this time and enjoyed there great friendship among
boyars, was angry that his favorite city was given not to him but to Yuri, and he
would not abandon Rostoff for Vladimir at the command of Big Nest. This was not his
first disobedience. His father had not forgotten the campaign of Ryazan, when Constantine
spoke against him in the presence of others. Big Nest repeated the command. Constantine
refused a second time, and sent a demand that Rostoff should be given with Vladimir.
The Grand Prince was grieved and distressed at his son’s disobedience, and there was
no measure to his anger. As a result that took place which up to this time had been
unknown in Russia: Big Nest deprived his eldest son of <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>seniority, and gave it to his second son, Yuri. From all the districts and towns in
Vladimir he summoned an assembly of priests, merchants, nobles, and people, with Yoan,
the bishop, at the head of them, and in their presence gave the capital of Vladimir
to Yuri, imposing on him seniority. He commanded Yuri’s brothers to obey him, and
they kissed the cross to do so. Then the people kissed the cross to the Grand Prince,
that they would obey Yuri. From this came endless contention in the family of Big
Nest, who died shortly after. He expired at the age of fifty-eight, Sunday, April
15, 1212, at the hour when mass was ending in all the churches of Vladimir. They buried
him near his brother Andrei in the golden-domed cathedral, the day following his death,
as was the custom at that time.
</p>
<p>After this began ceaseless troubles, not in Galitch, Kief, and Chernigoff, where there
was never an end to trouble, but in Vladimir, where for thirty-seven years peace and
quiet had flourished. Deprived of seniority, Constantine did not accept the decision
of his father, but warred against Yuri and Yaroslav, who stood firmly together. Vladimir
and Sviatoslav wavered, joining now one, now the other side. Vladimir, the youngest
brother, wished Moscow as his part, but expelled from Moscow by Yuri, he obtained
his father’s inheritance in the South,—Gorodok and Pereyaslavl. Yuri offered Constantine
peace, and even Vladimir, but asked Rostoff for himself. Constantine would not yield;
he would give Suzdal, and take Vladimir, only if Rostoff were given him also.
</p>
<p>Yuri freed the Ryazan and Murom princes imprisoned by his father. Strengthened by
them, he could war against his brother more successfully. Constantine, leaving for
a time his attempt on Vladimir, continued hostile action in northern places. He seized
Saligalsk, and burned Kostroma. The whole principality was in conflict from Vologda
to Moscow. A second and a third year after the death of Big Nest this struggle continued.
</p>
<p>Finally, Mystislav the Gallant, their now all-powerful neighbor in Novgorod, the main
decider of wars and disputes in Russia at that time, interfered. He had made two campaigns
against the Fins near the Baltic, and inflicted sharp punishment, but he was eager
for weighty deeds and great actions, not on distant borders, but in Russia. His cousins,
the grandsons of the “monk loving” <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>Rostislav, turned to him for succor, and protection. Chermny, now prince in Kief,
was driving them from Dnieper regions. “The Kief prince will not give us a part in
the Russian land,” complained they. “Come thou and help us.”
</p>
<p>Mystislav summoned the assembly and bowed down before Novgorod, saying: “I am going
to Kief to rescue my relatives. Will ye aid me?” “If thou go, we will follow,” was
the answer. The men chosen set out under Tverdislav, but at Smolensk the Novgorod
men had a quarrel and killed a Smolensk man; they refused thereupon to go farther,
saying: “We promised to conduct the prince hither, but to Kief we will not go.”
</p>
<p>Mystislav embraced the posadnik, kissed all the officers, then he bowed to the Novgorod
men, bidding Godspeed to them, and moved forward with only his personal following
and Smolensk warriors.
</p>
<p>The Novgorod men were not pleased with themselves, and they halted. “Lord brothers,”
said Tverdislav, “what ye decide will be done at all hazards. The question is ought
we to abandon our prince at this juncture. In their day our fathers and grandfathers
marched to suffer at Kief when their prince commanded. It is clear that we should
act in the old way.” Pleased with this speech, they turned, and with hurried marches
overtook Mystislav.
</p>
<p>Chermny’s fate was decided at Vyshgorod. His allies were crushed, and he fled. Two
of his cousins were captured. Ingvar of Volynia, who accompanied Mystislav, refused
the Kief throne, and Roman, son of Mystislav of Smolensk, obtained it. Vladimir, son
of Rurik, received Smolensk in addition to districts near Kief inherited from his
father. So Chermny was unable to keep his promise to avenge Igor’s sons and expel
all descendants of Monomach from Dnieper regions. Mystislav the Gallant now besieged
Chermny in Chernigoff, and imposed peace on him. Chermny died soon after, leaving
as heir his son Michael, who later on ruled in Kief and Novgorod. His name is still
known and revered among Russians, not because he ruled, but because he died a martyr’s
death among Mongols.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">DANIEL OF GALITCH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mystislav returned to Novgorod in triumph, but the mad rage of factions had not become
weaker in the interval, and he was forced to take strong measures. Many boyars were
banished, and many were imprisoned. Mitrophan, the archbishop famed for justice, who
had received his office not against the will of Novgorod, but who was a friend of
Big Nest, was not acceptable to Mystislav’s adherents. He was exiled to Toropet; more
than that, he was imprisoned.
</p>
<p>During Mystislav’s absence and after his return, Vladimir partisans were not idle.
Mystislav learned that he could not rely on support in Novgorod. He learned also that
there was even a movement to expel him. He was not the man to let any one show him
the road, hence he called the assembly on a sudden, and took farewell of it. “I have
work to do in Russia,” said he; “and ye are free as to princes.” All were astounded
on hearing this, but Mystislav, while “standing on one foot in Novgorod, had the other
in Galitch,” whither Leshko had called him most earnestly. Leshko had been summoned
more than once to the throne in Cracow. After the crowning of Koloman, the small boy,
and Salomeya, the little maiden, their fathers endured not long in friendship. What
the king had given Leshko in Galitch, he withdrew very quickly. That happened which
happens generally with guardians who have squandered property confided to them. The
heirs demanded account touching management.
</p>
<p>Roman’s sons were growing rapidly. Vassilko had reached an age when he could sit on
a horse, and take part in campaigning, while Daniel was nearing strong manhood, and
gave promise of having the powers that would make him as great as his father. He complained
loudly of Leshko, the guardian who was keeping <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>possession of his towns on the Būg, and his inheritance beyond it. It was at this
time that King Andrei took from Leshko what he had given him in Galitch. Seeing no
profit in the fact that his daughter was queen in “Galicia,” Leshko looked on Hungarians
with envy, since they treated Galitch as if it belonged to them, and he could not
conceal his vexation on this point. He saw that of Russian princes there was only
one who had genius in fighting; that one was Mystislav the Gallant, hence he invited
that prince to assist him.
</p>
<p>Mystislav, through relationship with Ingvar, was a natural ally of that branch, and
not of the heirs of Roman. His preference for Ingvar was shown by offering him the
Kief throne. When Mystislav drove Chermny from Kief and asked Ingvar to that capital,
it seems that Leshko sent him letters, and when the victor went back to Novgorod Leshko
sent envoys who offered him Galitch. When Sudislav, the boyar who favored Hungarians,
heard of Mystislav’s coming, he preferred Daniel, and sent to him promising assistance.
But Mystislav was too quick for this movement. As he approached Galitch, the Hungarians
withdrew, and with them went Sudislav. Mystislav entered the capital without opposition,
but, with all his good-will for Bailski, he was glad now to see Daniel, who joined
him. Instead of ill-will there was friendship between the two princes, and Mystislav
gave Anna, his daughter, to Daniel in marriage. Daniel, who was of the oldest line
among Monomach’s descendants, was connected now with the Smolensk branch of this line,
and with the younger line also, since Mystislav’s eldest daughter had married Yaroslav,
son of Big Nest.
</p>
<p>To all friends of Galitch Daniel’s marriage seemed of good omen, but to ill-wishers
and enemies it was hateful. Daniel grew more and more hostile to Leshko, and more
and more stubbornly demanded the return of the Brest lands. He complained to Mystislav
of his enemy in the guise of a guardian. “Leshko,” said he, “has taken many towns
of mine, and holds a good part of my inheritance. Assist me.” “My son,” replied Mystislav,
“I cannot make war on him now, for he has shown friendship, but thou canst find other
allies.”
</p>
<p>Daniel acted. He won back many towns, and warred against Leshko successfully. Leshko
doubted not that this winning was effected through Mystislav’s counsel, and in view
of this he changed <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>his plans quickly. The Poles and Hungarians, from being enemies, suddenly became friends.
Leshko sent a message to Hungary that he yielded Galitch gladly to Koloman, his son-in-law.
With that Andrei immediately allied himself with Leshko, and declared war against
Mystislav and Daniel. Leshko led in a strong army. A still greater force came from
Hungary. Mystislav wished to attack in the rear, hence he moved toward Zbruch, and
ordered his son-in-law to defend Galitch. He summoned Bailski, also, and commanded
both allies to retire into Galitch and defend it. But Bailski left this difficult
task to Daniel, who had to bear the whole brunt of the attack of Hungarian and Polish
forces. He yielded no whit, however, and defended the city successfully.
</p>
<p>The allies now raised the siege and turned all their strength against Mystislav, who
was acting in their rear. Mystislav spared his scant forces, and, while withdrawing,
commanded Daniel to march out of Galitch and join him. It was easy to give this command,
but far from easy to obey it. Mystislav himself, by deft action, slipped away without
loss, marching quickly to Kamenyets and thence to the Ros River.
</p>
<p>Daniel found himself now in a perilous position. The allies with united strength,
rushed at his army. It was difficult to withdraw from Galitch, and extremely difficult
to retreat along the whole course of the Dniester, repelling the ceaseless attacks
of keen enemies who disputed each step that his men made. These enemies were much
encouraged by Mystislav’s withdrawal. Their forces were vastly greater, and Daniel’s
men lacked provisions. Night and day marches, cold and hunger, fighting on horseback,
riding without food and sleep for nights and days in succession; all this the young
warrior had to live through in that murderous retreat down the Dniester. The glory
of this march was shared by his father’s chief boyars, who were with him. Even they
were astonished by the valor of their leader, still a stripling. They saw with wonder
how he fought entire days without dismounting, how he rushed in pursuit of the enemy,
who only saved themselves through the swiftness of their horses.
</p>
<p>Daniel’s men suffered greatly from lack of food. It happened that on the festival
of Saint Dmitri, when tortured with hunger, they saw on a sudden a long line of wagons
hastening forward to market. They seized the wagons, ate abundantly, and thanked the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>Holy Martyr for feeding them. When at last they reached that point in the Dniester
where they had to cross, and found no bridge or ford, they despaired of escape; but
all at once they saw many merchant boats sailing toward them from the Oleshya. On
those boats all of Daniel’s men were conveyed to the opposite bank of the river, and
given provisions.
</p>
<p>When Daniel brought his weary troops to Podolia, Mystislav marveled at this deed of
great skill and endurance. He showed every favor to the young hero, gave him his favorite,
his very best horse, as a present. “Go now to Vladimir, the capital of thy Volynia,”
said he, “and we will avenge this insult most surely.” And he gave assurance that
he would go to the steppes and return with Polovtsi forces. From his youth, steppe
life in tents had been pleasing to Mystislav. In those early days he found a wife
among Polovtsi maidens.
</p>
<p>Daniel, awaiting the time of fresh action, returned to his capital, but Mystislav
did not go directly to the Polovtsi. He appeared soon after in Novgorod. During his
absence many changes had taken place. The prince sent from Vladimir by Yuri had been
replaced by one sent from Kief by Mystislav, son of the Smolensk prince, Roman. Neither
man pleased “Lord Novgorod.” The first, alarmed at disorders, hastened home to his
father; the second found still greater trouble. Bloody battles took place on the streets,
and again a posadnik was murdered.
</p>
<p>Novgorod turned to Yuri a second time. “If thy son will not stay with us, send Yaroslav,
thy brother,” said they. Yaroslav seemed indeed just the prince needed in Novgorod,
and the friends of Mystislav the Gallant might think to find in him the prince for
whom they had been seeking a long time, for was he not intimate with Mystislav, being
married to his eldest daughter? Partisans also saw in him the best of his family.
</p>
<p>But when Yaroslav came to Novgorod an outburst so tremendous was taking place in the
city, that no man had ever seen its like before. The passions of the people and the
wild rage of parties had never been so violent. It turned out, too, that Yaroslav
himself was of those called “young, but early.” Men were mistaken when they thought
to find in him a son-in-law who would agree with Mystislav. He was a genuine Vladimir
prince, hence in no way inclined to preserve the famed liberties of Novgorod. <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>He had one thought alone: to acquire additions for Vladimir. Mystislav’s adherents
immediately conceived a deep hatred for Yaroslav, the most irascible among all the
sons of Big Nest. So acute was their feeling that, while warming his palace, he was
threatened with banishment. To make up for this hatred, his adherents “raised their
heads and stood up for the prince like a mountain.” They advised him to go to Torjok
and rule from there, holding Novgorod with all firmness.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav went to Torjok, and then chose his own method. When a message was sent to
him saying: “Come thou to Novgorod,” he seized the envoys and conveyed them to Pereyaslavl
Beyond the Forest, imprisoning them on an island. Novgorod now rose as one man against
Yaroslav. Meanwhile, he sat in Torjok very quietly, laughed at the city, and gave
command to seize Novgorod merchants and their wares on all roads in Vladimir. A multitude
of Novgorod men were arrested and imprisoned. To add to the misfortunes of the city,
the harvest that year was a failure in Novgorod regions. Yaroslav did not let one
load of wheat reach the city. From these severe measures, there was such hunger that
parents sold their children for bread, and unclean things were eaten. People died
on the streets, and their dead bodies lay on the roads, where hungry dogs devoured
them.
</p>
<p>Novgorod sent envoys to Yaroslav, begging him to return to the city, but he gave no
answer, and arrested the envoys. Novgorod sent a third time. “Come to thy place; come
to Holy Sophia. If thou wilt not come, declare thy intention,” begged they. Yaroslav,
as usual, detained the envoys. The men in confinement at this time numbered two thousand.
There was “wailing and great sorrow in Novgorod.”
</p>
<p>All at once, in the midst of these terrors, Mystislav the Gallant appeared in the
city. No man there knew whence he came. Yaroslav, who learned of his coming, sent
a detachment to arrest him, but this detachment surrendered to Mystislav. The first
thing the gallant prince did was to seize all known partisans of Yaroslav, and put
them in irons. Then, summoning the assembly and kissing the cross before the whole
people, he said to them: “Either the men and the lands of Great Novgorod will be freed,
or I will lay down my life for the city.” “In life or in death we are with thee!”
called out the citizens in answer.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mystislav’s first move was to send a peaceful embassy to negotiate with Yaroslav.
He selected a priest, the most famed and beloved in the city, as a sign that negotiations
were to be carried on, not with threats, but with love, and conscientiously. He gave
command to bow down to his son-in-law, saying: “My son, free the Novgorod merchants
and men. Treat with me kindly. Leave Torjok for thy own place.”
</p>
<p>Yaroslav dismissed the priest without discussion. Not only did he not free the prisoners,
but those whom he held in Torjok he put in chains, and sent to Pereyaslavl Beyond
the Forest. Their property and goods he distributed among his attendants. The moment
that news of this came to Novgorod, Mystislav commanded to sound the bell of the assembly.
The whole city came to him. “Let us go, brothers!” said he. “Let us rescue our lands.
Let us liberate our own people!”
</p>
<p>The war from the very beginning assumed an unusual character. The citizens of Novgorod
had a single mind this time, and the prince was at one with the people. To take vengeance
for injustice was their war-cry. Mystislav was not simply enraged against his son-in-law;
he hated in him that inborn pride of the Vladimir princes. Knowing well that this
unendurable haughtiness rested really on power, knowing well that they had a great
multitude of people behind them, and a very large army, the strong warrior looked
forward, not to a brilliant victory in this unequal conflict, but rather to the crown
of a martyr, and prepared for the struggle with fear, but also with fortitude. He
summoned from Pskoff that brother of his whom Mystislav the Brave on his death-bed
had committed to Yuri Zaharitch, the boyar. This brother, Vladimir, called to join
him his cousin Vladimir, son of Rurik, he who had taken the throne of Smolensk, when
Mystislav, son of Roman of Smolensk, went to rule Kief, the old capital.
</p>
<p>Mystislav the Gallant worked untiringly. Novgorod assembled all possible warriors,
but in number they were insufficient. Mystislav doubted not that Yaroslav and Yuri,
Grand Prince of Vladimir, would act as one man, but he counted on Constantine, who
in his eyes seemed another victim of Vladimir’s self-will and insolence. To Constantine,
and not to Yuri, belonged the throne of Vladimir, by right of birth. To deprive a
son of his God-given inheritance was a sin in Mystislav’s eyes, and he thought that
when he entered <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>the Vladimir principality, proclaiming to Yaroslav and Yuri that he was there to reinstate
their eldest brother, Constantine would assist him. To instate the senior son seemed
to Mystislav just and proper.
</p>
<p>Constantine enjoyed general respect; he was mild, and not haughty. To punish Yaroslav
for his cruelty to Novgorod was identified in Mystislav’s mind with reëstablishing
the old order, violated by the whim of Big Nest. The only fault found with the son,
as Mystislav thought, was that he liked not innovations established by Andrei Bogolyubski—Constantine
defended the ancient order. Hatred for Andrei was inherited by Mystislav, and he looked
on Big Nest as he looked on Andrei.
</p>
<p>When the gallant prince approached Torjok, Yaroslav withdrew, and his Novgorod friends
in that place followed promptly. Vladimir partisans came to strengthen Yaroslav, who
hurried now to join Yuri, and the brothers marched to meet the invader.
</p>
<p>Mystislav’s campaign was swift and decisive beyond parallel. Begun the moment Yaroslav
rejected peaceful offers with insult, the season was most inconvenient, just when
roads were breaking up at Easter, which that year fell on April 10 Old Style. Still
the campaign was ended before the roads had dried thoroughly.
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, March 1, Mystislav moved out of Novgorod. He permitted his warriors to
seize food, but forbade them most sternly to harm the inhabitants. He found Torjok
abandoned. Fearing lest Constantine might join his brothers and attack in the rear,
he was greatly relieved when that prince sent his vanguard as aid, and also the news
that he was coming in person. Mystislav now moved forward rapidly to the depths of
Vladimir. He marched through the enemy’s country, taking not only food and forage,
but booty of all kinds. As they advanced, his men burned everything before them, and
seized many captives. The Pskoff prince now met Constantine, “their third friend,”
as Mystislav called him. He arrived on Holy Saturday. Constantine himself led the
troops, and there was immense joy at his coming. The allies passed Easter together,
and then pressed forward in Holy Week. The roads were so bad, and Mystislav was hastening
on so eagerly, that he was obliged to leave his wagons behind.
</p>
<p>On the Sunday after Easter, they beheld Pereyaslavl Beyond the Forest, Yaroslav’s
capital, but they learned that the prince <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>had gone, taking all his men with him. Yuri, determined not to let any enemy come
near his capital, marched out to join Yaroslav, and met him near Yurieff, on the famed
banks of the Koloksha, where a battle had been fought in the days of Yuri Dolgoruki.
The place was better known, however, through two other battles, one fought somewhat
more than a hundred years earlier, in Monomach’s day, when the first Mystislav, great-grandfather
of Mystislav the Gallant, leading Novgorod regiments, crushed Oleg’s forces, and drove
him to Ryazan. On this same field, fifty years later, Big Nest inflicted a dreadful
defeat on the descendants of those same Ryazan men, and settled the fate of their
prince.
</p>
<p>Yuri and Yaroslav fixed their camp on that field, renowned through the deeds of their
ancestors. They had not the least doubt of their own triumph and the inevitable ruin
of their enemies, all the more as preponderance in numbers was immensely on their
side. Yuri’s brothers were all under the banner of their Grand Prince, except Constantine.
The forces of Murom had come, there were many Novgorod citizens, and all the Torjok
men. The main force, however, was from the countless villages and towns of the Vladimir
principality, excepting that part held by Constantine. In the number of its towns
and in its military structure, Vladimir surpassed every other division of Russia.
Besides local forces, or <i>militia</i>, there were irregulars, introduced by Yuri Dolgoruki. The nucleus of this force had
been formed from steppe tribes, though much of its character had been changed by the
gradual addition of local people. It had grown to large dimensions, and resembled
greatly the later time Cossack force.
</p>
<p>When Mystislav began the campaign and took Zubtsoff, he sent to Yaroslav, saying that
he did not like to make war on Vladimir, that peace would be better. “I do not want
peace,” replied Yuri; “to your one man we have a hundred.” “Thou hast power, but we
have the cross,” answered Mystislav. A month had not passed after that, when the opponents
stood face to face, waiting for battle. The battle came April 21, 1216, and from the
place on the Lipetsk held by Constantine it was called the “Lipetsk battle,” and the
victory which was won there was called by a name used only once in Russian chronicles,—“The
monstrous victory.”
</p>
<p>The Smolensk regiments of Vladimir, son of Rurik, and those led from Pskoff by Vladimir,
as well as those brought by Constantine, <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>were all given to Mystislav. He, with his Novgorod men and his personal following,
formed the soul of the action. He was chosen with one voice to lead the warriors.
In his name negotiations were conducted. He sent to say to Yuri: “We bow to thee,
brother. From thee there is no offense, and has not been at any time; the offense
is from Yaroslav.” Yuri answered:
</p>
<p>“Yaroslav and I are one. Ye have come to us; we shall see how ye leave us.” Mystislav
now gave command to say to Yaroslav: “Free thou our Novgorod men, and withdraw from
Torjok. Make peace with us, and let no blood be shed.” “The men whom I took,” answered
Yaroslav, “I shall retain. The army has seized all their property; where could I find
it at this day?” Then the allies met in council, and again sent proposals of peace
to Yuri and Yaroslav, with the statement that this message was final: “Brothers, we
have come not to spill blood, not for conflict, not for ruin, not to take your rightful
possessions. God forbid. We are all of one stock and race. We have come to arrange
matters in accord with God’s truth, and Russian justice. Give your eldest brother
seniority. Seat him in Vladimir, and the Suzdal lands may belong to you.” Yuri sent
answer: “Though our father could not make terms with Constantine, ye think to make
him agree with us! Go to the places whence ye came. We do not wish peace with you;
we do not need it.” Both brothers commanded to say specially to Constantine, that
they considered all discussion ended, and were ready for battle.
</p>
<p>Yuri and Yaroslav had such power that they were confident of success, and made a feast
in their tents where joy was loud and unbounded. They drank and were gladsome. They
boasted that a battle would show on whose side was justice. “They have come,” said
Yuri, “but how will they leave us?” The feast ended by sending a message to Mystislav,
stating that they were marching to Lipetsk and would receive battle, if there were
forces to meet them. That same day, Mystislav assembled a council and accepted the
challenge to meet for a life and death struggle, and all kissed the cross to obey
him.
</p>
<p>The allies feared Constantine’s weakness, remembering that he had not come very promptly,
that he had delayed at the outset, and might even now join his brothers. But Constantine
gave the oath asked of him, and was first on the battle-field. In his regiments <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>trumpet calls did not cease all that night, which was passed in alarm and preparations
for battle. In the morning, however, it was seen that the princes who had challenged
had evaded. Instead of being at the spot agreed upon for action Yuri and Yaroslav
had moved in the night to another position. They had selected a place with a deep
gully stretching in front of it, while near by was “Widow Hill.” They had strengthened
this camp with palisades, and their wagons. Mystislav and his allies occupied a height
close to Yurieff. Constantine disposed his men toward Lipetsk. To get at the enemy
now, Mystislav would have to cross the gully.
</p>
<p>Yuri and Yaroslav, feeling safe at Widow Hill, did not think of fighting, no matter
how Mystislav challenged. To reach the hill through the gully was impossible. So Mystislav
sent three men to parley, and again proposed peace as an end to the quarrel. “If ye
will not make peace, then come to the field, we will meet you; or if ye choose we
will go to Lipetsk and ye can attack us.” “We will not give peace, and we will not
abandon our position,” replied the two brothers. “Ye have crossed our whole land;
can ye not cross this small gully?”
</p>
<p>Mystislav commanded his men then to advance at all hazards. But no matter how he approached
Widow Hill, he could not entice the two brothers to leave it. He then decided to march
on Vladimir directly, and seize the town if possible. He commanded to raise the camp
quickly. At once Yurieff Mountain was seething, and soon the army marched down, and
moved off on the road to the capital. The Pskoff prince now joined the main body.
But Constantine delayed yet at Lipetsk, where doubt and dissension seemed evident.
He feared “the desperate move,” as he called it. He said that his men were simple
villagers, unaccustomed to battle; he feared that they might disperse on the march.
It was better, he thought, to remain on Yurieff Mountain. Mystislav answered with
passion: “The mountain will give neither victory nor defeat! In the cross and in truth
lies our triumph.” Aided by his brother and cousin he at last convinced Constantine
that it was necessary to march on Vladimir, and he commanded his forces to advance.
</p>
<p>As soon as the regiments were moving on the road toward Vladimir, and before all had
reached the road, a stir at Widow Hill was observed, and directly the army of the
two brothers left its position. Both armies turned now toward the same side. <span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>There was an encounter at Lipetsk. Mystislav halted and the men of Smolensk and of
Novgorod faced the enemy. They stood without moving: Constantine was at Lipetsk on
one flank, Mystislav with Novgorod warriors held the center; on the other flank was
Vladimir, son of Rurik, with Smolensk men. Between him and the center was Mystislav’s
brother with Pskoff troops. The whole force of the enemy moved against them directly.
Yuri and Yaroslav were confident and smiling. Yuri’s warriors rushed straight at the
Novgorod regiments, to whom Mystislav had said already: “Brothers, we have come to
the heart of our enemy’s country, and that enemy is powerful. If we flee, not a man
of us will escape. Look not back in this battle. Forget homes, wives and children.
Fight to the death. He who is not killed will be living. Hit hard! God is in truth,
not in numbers. Forward like men! Hit hard! Forward on foot or on horseback, but forward!”
</p>
<p>The Novgorod men remembered the fight of their great-grandfathers when they were led
by the great-grandfather of Mystislav, and the blood rose in them. “We will not fight
on horseback,” said they. Steam was rolling now from the oncoming enemy. The Novgorod
men threw off their boots and upper clothing and rushed to the fight with axes and
clubs, vying with the men of Smolensk in their valor. Each man was bound to surpass
every other, and no crowd of men would stay behind any other crowd.
</p>
<p>The first standard cut down was a standard of Yaroslav; the second that fell was his
standard also. The battle became very soon a great slaughter. The Pskoff prince stood
at the side of his brother, and both watched the battle before them. All at once,
Mystislav said to Vladimir: “May God not permit us to abandon good men,” and he rushed
to the combat. Through the whole mass of his warriors did he ride, encouraging them,
saying that the moment for victory had come. He made his way through all the ranks
to the front, took from his shoulders the cord securing his battle-ax and swinging
the ax plunged, at the head of the warriors, into the thick of the fight. Men saw
how he hewed to the right and to the left. His warriors followed him with desperate
venom. In a short time the field was a scene of unpitying slaughter. Three times did
Mystislav go back and forth through the ranks of Vladimir, cutting down men right
and left with his terrible broadax. <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>The Smolensk prince and he of Pskoff broke through the ranks before them till they
reached the camp in the rear, now abandoned by Yaroslav and Yuri.
</p>
<p>Those princes, who had boasted of having a hundred warriors to one of Mystislav’s,
now found that for each one of Mystislav’s men killed or wounded, ten or even more
than that number had fallen on their own side. The groans of the wounded and the dying
reached Yurieff from the battle-field, as the people said afterward; and of corpses
on that field they counted nine thousand, not reckoning those borne away earlier.
</p>
<p>Then the defeated fled, and all their camp fell to the victors. Mystislav forbade
his men to touch anything. “Leave the camp,” said he, “and finish the battle, or they
will turn back and defeat you.” The Smolensk men could not refrain from plundering,
but the Novgorod warriors obeyed and rushed in pursuit of the enemy. Constantine was
the first man to stop fighting; when the tide turned to his side he fought no longer.
He pitied his brothers and did them no subsequent injury. Their army was terribly
defeated; whole regiments had been destroyed.
</p>
<p>Both Yuri and Yaroslav fled without looking behind them, the first to Vladimir, the
second toward Pereyaslavl Beyond the Forest. Yuri raced into Vladimir on the fourth
horse; he had ridden to death the other three. He had thrown away on the road all
his upper clothing, and even his saddle cloth. Yaroslav fled still more fiercely.
He rode four horses till they fell, and reached home on the fifth. The wounded and
maimed flowed into Yurieff and into every village around it. Many men were drowned
in crossing rivers, others died on the road. Every man cursed Yaroslav as the one
cause of evil; on him alone did they fix all the error.
</p>
<p>When in Vladimir people saw from the walls a horseman rushing toward the city, they
thought him a courier with glad tidings from their prince, but when he came nearer
they recognized Prince Yuri himself, in shirt and trousers. “Strengthen the town!
Strengthen the town!” shouted he, from a distance. Instead of joy, there was wailing.
During all that night broken remnants of the army were coming in; some of the warriors
almost dead, others wounded. If the victors had chosen to follow, neither Yuri nor
Yaroslav, nor any other man, could have escaped them. They might have taken the city
without resistance. But they remained <span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>all the following day on the battle-field, and drew near Vladimir only in the morning
on Sunday.
</p>
<p>By agreement with Yuri, the citizens had closed the gates. When he had drawn breath
and recovered his mind, he said to the people: “Let us keep the gates shut, brothers;
perhaps we can stand a siege.” “With whom can we stand it?” asked they. “Where are
our brothers? Some are killed, some are captives, others have rushed in here naked
and wounded. There is no one to work with us.” “That is true,” answered Yuri, “but
yield me not to Constantine, my brother, or to Vladimir or Mystislav. I wish of my
own will to meet them.” They promised what he asked.
</p>
<p>The allies, seeing the city closed, as if for a siege, surrounded it. During the night
between Sunday and Monday a fire broke out in the palace, and there was great uproar.
The Novgorod men wished to attack, and were climbing the walls, when Mystislav stopped
them. The fire was extinguished quickly, but a new fire burst out on Tuesday, two
hours after sunset, and burned until daybreak. The Smolensk men rushed to mount the
walls then, but were again forbidden. Yuri now sent a petition, saying, “Do not press
me; I will come out to meet you to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>On Wednesday he went to the enemy, taking with him his two younger brothers, Vladimir
and Sviatoslav. He bowed down to the victors, and said: “Brothers, I bow down to you,
do not deprive me of life, and let that be with Constantine which pleases you.”
</p>
<p>Constantine was made Grand Prince, and all was arranged to receive him with triumph.
To Yuri was assigned a small town near the Volga, whither he was to set out immediately.
His wife and attendants went at once to the boats which had been prepared for the
journey. People were greatly moved by the conduct of Simon, the bishop, who would
not part with Yuri. He had shared the sorrows and joys of the prince all his life,
and now he sailed down the Klyazma with him and his family. Before leaving for exile,
Yuri took farewell of his parents. He bowed down and prayed at the grave of Big Nest,
his father, and said, while weeping: “God is the judge of my brother. Behold to what
Yaroslav has brought me.” Afterwards he left in humility, no one appearing to note
his departure. He went to the small town assigned him, to his “little town;” thus
did he call the place of his exile without naming it.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p>As for Yaroslav, he was not tamed by defeat and suffering. The second week after Easter
the allies went to Pereyaslavl. Constantine appeared first. Yaroslav went forth, with
great gifts, to meet him, and opened the gates, begging his brothers not to surrender
him to Mystislav. Constantine, wishing to reconcile the two men, sent gifts to Mystislav
from his brother, whose part he took most earnestly. Mystislav would not yield, but
demanded his daughter, Yaroslav’s wife, and took her with him. Afterward Yaroslav
tried to recover the princess, but Mystislav paid no heed to his demands. Thus the
quarrel between the sons of Big Nest ended in Constantine’s triumph. He was installed
in Vladimir immediately, while Yuri and Yaroslav were effaced for the moment.
</p>
<p>A misfortune met Mystislav now: Vassili, his only son, died in Torjok, and was buried
in Holy Sophia, near the tomb of his grandfather. Soon after this, Mystislav the Gallant
left Novgorod. He promised to return, but this time, as appeared in the sequel, he
parted with the city forever. As was usual before meetings, he had the Sophia bell
sounded, and the people assembled thinking that they had been summoned for Novgorod
business. But Mystislav bowed on three sides to all present, and took farewell of
them solemnly. They could not credit his words: they had thought that he would remain
in their city till his death. He declared then the cause of his going: “I wish to
save Galitch.” They implored him to stay with them, and all cried out that they would
not let him leave Novgorod. “I shall never forget you,” said Mystislav. “God grant
me to lie down here at last near my father in Holy Sophia, but to-day I must go from
you.” And he left them.
</p>
<p>Indeed it was time to remember the promise given Daniel, and avenge the shame wrought
on them both by the Poles and Hungarians. If, when Roman was forced to leave Galitch,
the Latin Church made Galicia a bishopric, it is easy to imagine what happened under
Koloman and Salomeye. When this youthful king and queen had been crowned in obedience
to Rome, the Latin Church triumphed directly. Latin priests were installed, while
the Bishop of Galitch and Orthodox priests were expelled from their churches on all
sides. Mystislav now assembled Russian princes and roused them to this Galitch question.
Mystislav, <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>the Kief prince, having lost the favor of Mystislav the Gallant, was unable to help
him, but his other cousin, Vladimir of Smolensk, promised aid very willingly.
</p>
<p>Mystislav then went to Khan Kotyan, his father-in-law, and obtained warriors from
him. Daniel, son of Roman, was delighted to help in freeing Galitch.
</p>
<p>But if Russian princes were preparing to fight for their Galitch inheritance, the
men who had seized that inheritance were preparing to keep it. To Koloman came reinforcements
from his father. Leshko, dividing his army into two parts, sent one to defend his
young daughter in Galitch; the other he led to threaten Volynia. Depending on those
princes in Galitch who did whatever he asked of them, Leshko and Bailski, his ally,
threatened with these henchmen other princes, known allies of Mystislav. Bailski looked
on Daniel as Mystislav’s main ally.
</p>
<p>Daniel and his brother would have moved at once to help Mystislav, since they were
threatened earliest, but their possessions, both on the Polish and Russian side, were
attacked by swift enemies. They were met at every point by evil neighbors, “all men
were against them,” as the chronicler informs us. “Save from God they had no aid from
any one.”
</p>
<p>Mystislav waited for the Polovtsi; when they came he began action. His faithful friend
and ally, Prince Vladimir, brought with him the promised warriors of Smolensk, and
he and Mystislav then moved against Galitch. But Daniel did not go with them. They
received no word from him, for he was greatly occupied elsewhere. Daniel would have
been troubled to count the toils and battles which he passed through at that time.
With whom and where had he not struggled? In recent days his conflicts with Poles
had increased. They roused the Yatvyags against him and against those Lithuanians
who were under him. Daniel, defending these men, warred frequently in forests and
wild regions belonging to their enemy. He met the Poles themselves among his Lithuanian
subjects, whom the Polish princes tried to take from him through interference and
intrigues. The Poles also attacked Daniel on the Būg, where he was forced to meet
them, and through Bailz and Lutsk he met continual raids from Russian princes.
</p>
<p>Only after Mystislav had come and triumphed, could Daniel <span class="pageNum" id="pb200">[<a href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>breathe with some little freedom, but till Mystislav appeared the first blows of Poles,
and also of Hungarians, fell directly on him. Beginning with Benedict Bor, the famous
harrier of people, Hungarian magnates were frequent visitors in Galitch. Ruling in
the king’s name, they differed little from that renowned Bor known as “Antichrist.”
</p>
<p>In the time now before us, the chief man near Koloman was Filni, a magnate whom the
Russians nicknamed “Filya.” Hungarian magnates in those days were famous for haughtiness,
but Filya surpassed all Hungarians in this regard. Moreover, to this nickname was
added another; he was called “Filya the Important.” Of him people said, and this was
stamped on his countenance, that he thought his equal was not on the earth, that he
could embrace the whole world, and drink the whole sea up. It was known also that
though his pride was unbounded, his mind was quite limited. When on a time Filya was
warned before battle that his enemies were many and his strength insufficient, though
as a rule he avoided battle, he repeated, when moving his warriors: “A stone is but
one; still it breaks many pots just by moving.”
</p>
<p>Koloman and Salomeya reigned in Galitch, but all things were managed through Filya,
whose aids were traitorous boyars, of whom the chief man was Sudislav. These boyars
wished to merge Galitch in Hungary, and were hated by common folk. “Sudislav the traitor,
the disturber of the country,” were the only words used to describe this man.
</p>
<p>When news came that Mystislav the Gallant was marching, Filya and Sudislav made preparations
to defend the city. Filya placed himself at the head of Hungarian and Polish forces,
and put Sudislav in command of the Galitch men. He did not dream, in his confidence,
that the enemy could come near the capital, still he took measures to meet a siege
seriously. To show that in the building of fortresses he was not inferior to the celebrities
of that day, he strove in every way to make Galitch impregnable. In doing this he
roused the indignation of the Orthodox. He seized the cathedral, made it a fortress,
and added a tower to it.
</p>
<p>The excitement of the adherents of Hungary and Poland was extraordinary. Sudislav
and his friends, in their rage at the man who was moving Russian regiments against
them, declared that <span class="pageNum" id="pb201">[<a href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>Mystislav wanted to deliver all boyars to the Polovtsi, and settle the steppes with
them. Their hatred for Mystislav was boundless, and, through the efforts of Poles,
Hungarians, and their partisans among Russians, a venomous opposition was raised against
him. He had marched half-way from the Dnieper to the upper waters of the Dniester
and the San, when blood commenced to flow in Būg regions. At the opening of the war,
Leshko promised Filya to protect the rear of the Polish and Hungarian troops, which,
combined, seemed able to hurl aside Mystislav; and after that Filya was to finish
him. Leshko had undertaken besides to hold down Volynia, and not let it move to assist
Mystislav.
</p>
<p>Leshko entered Volynia territory and seized towns and cities. Daniel and Vassilko
had work in plenty near their own capital. Konrad, more honest than Leshko, his brother,
tried in vain to make him friendly to Daniel, and hostilities in Volynia continued.
If they were not of greater violence, and even fatal to Daniel, it was because Mystislav’s
campaign was ended with one blow, and so quickly that neither Filya nor Leshko could
foresee such a result. The Hungarian magnate had been deceived in the strength of
his enemy, and only came to his mind when Mystislav was near Galitch. Then he and
Sudislav hastened to lead forward their forces, and block the road to the gallant
prince.
</p>
<p>The place of meeting was a broad, rolling country, from the highest points of which
all other high places were visible. On lower slopes, and in depressions between one
round-topped high place and another, a commander might hide a whole army. Filya drew
up his warriors and disposed them in two camps apart from each other. It seemed to
him that no man could stand against this force. The Poles and Sudislav’s regiments
from Galitch were placed by themselves in one body. One of these forces was to meet
the oncoming enemy on his right, the other on his left flank.
</p>
<p>Mystislav, leaving in one of those deep depressions just mentioned his Polovtsi legions,
moved forward against Filya. From a distance he saw that the Poles were too far to
one side for their profit, hence he commanded Vladimir, his ally, to entice them away
with his warriors, who were eager for battle, and while struggling with them to retreat
toward the Polovtsi.
</p>
<p>The Poles met Vladimir’s men bravely, forced them back toward the ambush, and followed.
Mystislav marched with chosen regiments <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>and his personal following to the high place beyond which was Filya’s position. Relying
on the valor of his ally, whom he had tried against Yuri and Yaroslav, and on the
great number of the Polovtsi who were placed in ambush, he seemed to abandon Vladimir
and his men. The Poles followed the retreating Smolensk men toward the place where
the Polovtsi were waiting, as Mystislav could see clearly. Right in front of Mystislav
stood Filya. It was imprudent now to delay longer. Strengthening his army with the
name of the holy cross, he rushed at the enemy. The battle was grievous, but Mystislav
triumphed. The Hungarians were crushed, and Filya was captured.
</p>
<p>When the Poles had driven Vladimir as far as they wished, and had seized many prisoners
and much booty, they returned shouting victory. Not suspecting that Filya had been
terribly beaten, they marched back rejoicing, but, instead of finding Filya in possession
of the battle-field, they came upon Mystislav’s warriors, who rushed at them savagely.
Meanwhile Vladimir had turned, and with him came the Polovtsi. A great slaughter set
in. The Polovtsi took captive all the Poles who were not slain, taking from them their
arms and horses. But Mystislav’s men touched no booty. Following the enemy, as they
scattered in every direction, they slew without mercy. The whole field was covered
with bodies, and the streams which ran through it were crimsoned with blood.
</p>
<p>Mystislav stood before Galitch immediately, and demanded surrender, promising immunity
to all. Filya, in spite of his impregnable fortress, sent a courier advising surrender.
Since he himself had been beaten, he despaired of success through another. Mystislav
repeated his summons three times, but with Koloman were leaders who would not surrender;
they relied on the stronghold, and swore to endure to the end with their sovereign.
Sending out all who could not fight, so that there should be no useless mouths in
the city, they made ready for the siege.
</p>
<p>Mystislav declared that from that hour there would be no mercy shown to any man, and
he prepared to take Galitch by storm. The Hungarians were confident, and strengthened
the gates of the city. That Mystislav was digging a tunnel under their stronghold
they knew not, and that it was finished they only discovered one gloomy night when
his warriors rose through the earth and cut down the guards at the gate, which they
opened then to their comrades.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>At daybreak, Mystislav with his army was in Galitch. The leading Hungarians shut themselves
up in the church, which Mystislav surrounded. They were unyielding; they threw stones
and shot arrows, but at last they were captured. The magnates and their families,
for whom immense ransoms were expected, and some of the higher Poles, were divided
among the victors. Koloman, his queen, and Filya went to Mystislav. Sudislav, the
artful, fell at Mystislav’s feet, embraced his knees, wept, and swore that while living
he would serve him most faithfully. Mystislav, knowing little of Galitch, and seeing
the position which Sudislav held among boyars, not only left life to that traitor,
but gave a good town to him.
</p>
<p>The people magnified Mystislav now as the deliverer of Galitch; they called him the
shining sun, the bright falcon. Their delight at being freed from foreign men seemed
unbounded and heartfelt. When news came to Leshko of Filya’s defeat, he immediately
made peace with Daniel, and feigned immense love for him. Daniel wished now to see
Mystislav, his father-in-law, so he hurried off quickly to Galitch. The delight of
those two men was great. Not only were they avenged on Poles and Hungarians, but those
enemies had been paid back a hundredfold, and were eliminated as rulers from Galitch.
The Orthodox people said that God had given those two nations into their hands to
punish the enemy for defiling His temple, which had been turned by them into a bastion
of battle. The people did not forgive this “great sacrilege,” as they called it.
</p>
<p>Thus Hungarians and Poles perished in a land which they had planned to take from its
owners. Many were killed in battle, others were taken prisoners, still others perished
on the roads and in lonely villages. They died of hunger in forests, or were drowned
in crossing rivers. People rose up and slew the invaders wherever they found them.
Few escaped.
</p>
<p>On losing his son, Vassili, Mystislav had no heir left. His youngest daughter was
in tender years yet, his eldest daughter had married the son of Big Nest, Yaroslav,
whom he held in his power; his second daughter, Anna, was the wife of Daniel, who,
as heir to the great Roman, would have seemed the direct heir of Galitch. The people
thought that land would surely go now to Daniel, but deceit and intrigue disappointed
them. Not only in <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>Galitch but in Volynia there were falsehoods, conspiracies, and endless struggles.
Mystislav’s victory changed the form, not the substance of the misery. Men now persuaded
the prince to take Galitch himself, and Daniel was set aside promptly. At the prayers
of Koloman’s father, peace was concluded, and reports were sent out that Mystislav
was to give his youngest daughter in marriage to King Andrei’s second son.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Volynia Bailski made war against Daniel. Daniel defeated his enemy, and
was ready to give the last blow to him, when Mystislav commanded his son-in-law to
withdraw and not trouble Bailski in future. Andrei and Leshko from having been enemies
of Mystislav became his friends in appearance, but their friendship was more deadly
to Russia than their enmity had ever been. Supported by Leshko and Mystislav, Bailski
acquired so much influence that Roman’s sons lost all the power they had won. Bailski
made use of the open and unbounded confidence of Mystislav, who was a great man in
battle, but short-sighted and incompetent as a ruler, and strove to persuade him to
a direct war against Daniel. In this he was aided considerably by Leshko, and though
they failed at first, they succeeded later on. So neither Volynia nor Galitch gained
anything from Mystislav’s victory.
</p>
<p>Forgetting for the moment all care touching Galitch, Daniel established himself firmly
in his own place, which, notwithstanding the woes of that period, he served very sensibly.
He took from Leshko the border lands that the Poles had attached to Mazovia. Though
the profit of this winning did not seem much at the time, it proved very great in
the sequel.
</p>
<p>Brest was at first a border settlement of Russia, beyond which were the Yatvyags and
the Lithuanians. In ruling those regions, the Russians did not quarrel with their
Lithuanian neighbors. The Lithuanians had long been protected by Russian princes,
to whom they paid a small tribute. The Poles, after seizing the country, acted differently
and harshly with these people. When Daniel restored the places to Russia, the whole
country breathed much more freely. All the elders, or, as the Russians called them,
princes, sent solemn declarations of peace to Daniel, and thereafter he found in them
faithful allies against Leshko. Those tribes had many relatives, both in the Baltic
country and in Poland, who would help them when proper agreements were made. They
<span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>now aided Daniel against his Polish opponents, and with their assistance he carried
on further struggles with Leshko. At this time there was a special movement among
Lithuanian tribes, which till then had been quiescent.
</p>
<p>When Mystislav the Gallant went to the South and did not return, the North ceased
to think of him. There were no lasting results from his victories and exploits, either
in Novgorod or Vladimir. Constantine, son of Big Nest, who had never been stalwart
of body, died in 1217, shortly after he had taken the throne of Vladimir. He had made
a friend of Yuri, his brother, and, when dying, committed his children to Yuri, who
after Constantine’s death was again ruling prince in Vladimir. Yaroslav, while Prince
of Pereyaslavl, continued to occupy Novgorod at intervals. He held Turjok as though
it had been a part of Vladimir, and no matter what prince was acting in Novgorod,
Yaroslav’s hand never ceased to be felt there. The Novgorod men could not live without
Yaroslav, or be content with him. At this time, to round out their troubles, their
way to the sea was cut off by German knights, the Chuds (Fins), and Lithuanians, against
whom they warred frequently. Yaroslav, in fighting with these enemies of Novgorod,
went far into the country. He marched to places where no Russian prince had ever preceded
him.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">BALTIC PROVINCES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To understand the difficulties of the situation in the north Baltic region, it will
be necessary to describe it somewhat in detail. In the tenth century the Russian coast
on the Baltic belonged to the Polotsk principality, to Pskoff and to Novgorod. The
western part, that which had the Dvina River for its artery, belonged to the Polotsk
princes; north and east of that were the Pskoff possessions, and last of all those
of Novgorod.
</p>
<p>The Polotsk coast was inhabited by tribes known collectively as Kors and Livs. Later
on, their territory was called by the Germans Korland and Livland. The part belonging
to Pskoff was occupied by Chud, or Fin tribes. The Russians gave no collective name
to these regions, but called each group by its own name; a good proof that they were
left in great part to themselves.
</p>
<p>Though all those tribes paid tribute to Pskoff, Polotsk or Novgorod, they were not
disturbed in their mode of living. During almost a century and a half the Russian
princes built no forts or strongholds in that country. From Polotsk to the sea there
were but few places. Gersiké and Kuikenos were the capitals of those lands which belonged
to Polotsk. At the beginning of the eleventh century, the Polotsk region was ruled
by Prince Vsevolod, whose wife was a Lithuanian. In Kuikenos was Prince Vyacheslav.
The country was left mainly to the care of its inhabitants. They paid tribute and
kept landing-places and portages. After the manner of primitive people, they had many
disputes among themselves, but in those disputes the Russian princes meddled little;
their main interest was to receive tribute, and have an open road to the sea. Christianity
was spreading gradually, though no great effort was made to change the primitive religion.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of the twelfth century, Bremen merchants <span class="pageNum" id="pb207">[<a href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>visited the Baltic coast of Russia and established small landing-places and villages.
One of these was called Dalen, another Holm, a third Ikskul. The latter was on the
Dvina about twenty-five miles from its mouth, and was simply the native village of
Ikeskola; here the Germans built a small fort with a warehouse. They knew well that
this coast belonged to Russia, and was a part of the Polotsk principality, and their
thought was how to get possession of it.
</p>
<p>To Vladimir, Prince of Polotsk, came one day a man of God, an old monk, Meinhardt
by name. He had, he said, devoted all his life to God, and, being in the Polotsk country,
wished to work for God there. He thought it his duty to bow down before Vladimir,
who held all that region of the Dvina, and to beg permission to preach the word of
God among the pagan tribes of the Baltic coast. Vladimir received him kindly and gave
the desired permission.
</p>
<p>Ten years passed. Suddenly it was announced throughout the Polotsk principality that
the Kors and Livs were attacking the Germans. In the course of those ten years wonderful
things had happened. When the monk Meinhardt went from Prince Vladimir to Ikeskola
with a greeting from the prince, the people listened to his words willingly; he was
himself astonished at the success of his preaching. His flock increased rapidly. People
came from far and near to be baptized; they came by families and then by whole villages.
He built a church in Ikeskola and one also in Holm.
</p>
<p>But, strangely enough, this monk knew how to build fortresses. Besides being a spiritual
leader, he was a warrior of much skill. During his first winter in the country, 1186–1187,
Ikeskola was attacked by a neighboring tribe. Meinhardt armed his spiritual children
with clubs and axes, and set out against the enemy. He made an ambush and gained a
great victory. After that, conversion went on still more rapidly. The monk meanwhile
persuaded the people to build a stone fortress. He brought in German masons and mechanics,
and the following summer he built two large castles with towers, in fact regular fortresses,
at Ikeskola and Holm.
</p>
<p>Besides merchants and mechanics, warriors began to appear in the country, and Meinhardt
invited in Latin monks to assist <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>him in his spiritual labors. He sent one of these monks, Dietrich, to convert people
in the neighborhood of Aa River. This man was acquainted with medicinal plants and
could heal the sick; but he was greatly disliked. The people were suspicious of him.
Finally he was seized and condemned to be burned alive, but his life was spared through
soothsaying. Before burning him, the people placed a spear on the ground and led a
horse up to it; the horse crossed it with the “foot of life.” The people would not
believe, they demanded a second trial; the result was the same. They freed the monk,
and thereafter Meinhardt kept him near his person,—not as a preacher, but as an adviser.
</p>
<p>Of the most important elders of his church, Meinhardt formed a body-guard. Among those
men he chose certain ones who were to act as spies and inform him of every secret.
These he distinguished above others, and rewarded. He sent them to persuade the people,
and by degrees the most stubborn yielded.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile German commerce flourished. From Holm, or Kirchholm, as Meinhardt called
the place after his church was built, and Ikeskola new villages were founded. Taking
the name of the Livs, the whole country was now called by the Latinized term Livonia,
and the churches were mentioned as “the Church of Livonia.” It might seem that this
work was one that could never be undone. But all at once there was a tempest—a wild
revolt throughout the whole country. A thing unheard of, a spectacle unique in Christianity
was presented to the eyes of the “Apostle of Livonia,” as disciples called Meinhardt,
when those same people who had received baptism from him sprang into the Dvina, washed
themselves clean of his apostolic touch, dived in the water “to purify their persons.”
“Behold!” shouted they to him. “We have cleansed ourselves from German baptism.” And
looking at the waves of the river rushing toward the sea, they added: “Be off from
us, far away. Go to the place whence thou hast come.” In this manner the whole country
gave back its baptism to the German monk.
</p>
<p>Meinhardt began to threaten. He would sail away; he would find a legion of defenders
of Christ and bring them back on countless ships. Then they would see how God punished
apostates, they would see the awful power of Christ’s vicar on earth, by whom he,
Meinhardt, had been deputed. This threat alarmed the people; <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>they became tearful and begged him not to leave them. Instead of going himself, he
sent Dietrich.
</p>
<p>Why did the people rise? “Because they differed little from beasts, were wild and
rude. There had been great religious excitement, and this uprising was simply a reaction.”
This is the explanation of certain historians, but a further statement should be added:
The monk had begun to enforce obedience to the Archbishop of Bremen, and to demand
tithes for “the church.” The “Apostle of Livonia” was a faithful servant of the Archbishop
of Bremen. He was made Bishop of Livonia in subjection to Bremen in 1188, and died
in 1196.
</p>
<p>The monk Berthold, an abbot of the Cistercian Order, appointed to fill Meinhardt’s
place, heard that the people were considering whether to burn him in the church or
drown him in the river. He shut himself up in Kirchholm, but he had warriors clad
in steel from head to foot, with heavy swords at their sides, and sitting on mighty
horses, such as the people had never seen till that day. These were the “Knights.”
People sent to ask why this man of God had brought those warriors into the country.
“To punish apostates,” was the answer.
</p>
<p>The bishop now prepared for a serious uprising. He left Holm and encamped at the mouth
of the river Rigje. People began to gather from far and near, crowds of half-naked
men, armed with sharp sticks, clubs and axes. The more they increased, crowd after
crowd, the more they gathered courage. The knights let the natives assemble in the
greatest possible number—they did not hasten to begin the battle, but when at last
they did rush forward, they had not long to struggle for victory. It was impossible
to stop the onrush of the conquerors. The bishop, Berthold, in pursuing the people,
was carried away by excitement. He lost control of his spirited horse and became separated
from his men. The Livs immediately surrounded him, and chopped him into small bits.
</p>
<p>The triumph on the German side was complete, and they made a terrible use of it. It
might be said that the warriors of the cross became executioners. The people begged
for mercy, and promised to submit to baptism again, and to receive into the villages
the priests who had been driven out. But in vain did they plead. All were sentenced
to death. Separate divisions of knights passed <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>through the country, and in every village dealt out dreadful punishment to “apostates.”
</p>
<p>The youthful Livonian church was thus reëstablished. Then the Western crusaders, considering
their holy work finished, and their sins absolved, reëmbarked and sailed away home.
But all at once, and most unexpectedly, there was a new outburst of rage and indignation
through the whole country. The natives rushed at the “vile strangers,” killing or
beating them, and looting their homes. They intended to act in like manner with all
foreigners, but the merchants gave them great presents, and bought their good-will.
Those who had been re-baptized sprang a second time into the river, and a second time
washed themselves clean of the German religion.
</p>
<p>When this news reached Bremen and Rome, they decided to delay no longer, but acquire
Livonia in permanence. To do this they needed a military brotherhood warring for Christ.
</p>
<p>The Germans appeared now in a triple character: as a military order to strike down
opposition; as merchants to extend trade; as a church to bring all to the faith. As
their leader stood forth Albert von Apeldern Bukshevden, and to aid in subjecting
Livonia the Pope gave him permission to found a new knightly order, the members of
which would spend their lives in extending the Livonian church. Albert visited the
chief German cities, enlisted knights, and collected contributions for his great “patriotic
work.” His knights wore a white mantle on which was a red cross and a red sword. In
Russia they were called “Bearers of the Sword.” They took the name willingly, and
called themselves “Brothers of the Sword.”
</p>
<p>Albert’s first work was to build a fortress at the mouth of the river, and then began
the city of Riga at the village Rigje. In two years there was a fortress and a cathedral.
The people received him unwillingly. Being a keen politician, he opened negotiations
with the natives, and, when their elders went to him to conclude peace, he seized
them and threatened to send them to Germany. This threat brought the elders to terms,
and Albert obtained of their sons thirty as hostages. These were sent to Bremen to
be educated.
</p>
<p>Soon a dispute arose between Albert, the sovereign Bishop of Livonia, and the Order,
which wished on its part to rule the conquered <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>country. It was finally settled by the Pope, who divided the land into three parts.
One third was to go to the bishop; one third to the metropolitan of the city of Riga,
and one third to the Order. But the Order would not live in the same city with the
bishop, so they erected a castle,—Wenden. This castle and the city which grew up around
it became the capital of the Order. Here lived the “Grand Master,” as the Germans
entitled him. In every direction castles of barons and knights sprang up like mushrooms.
In proportion as the people were conquered and converted, they were turned into slaves
and forced to build strongholds for their masters. The material reward for saving
souls was all the land and all the people.
</p>
<p>Albert put to death unsparingly those who refused to be baptized. In villages where
the people tried to free themselves of their enslavers, the Germans killed whole crowds
of prisoners—in some cases the entire male population—and consumed the village with
fire. In other places, where they went into servitude meekly, they were taken on campaigns
against regions not yet subjected. The bishop favored quarrels between tribes, and
by skilful management used one tribe to subdue another. Thus also did he rouse tribes
against Russia; inspire them not to pay tribute to Pskoff or Novgorod, and promise
to liberate them with German assistance. He even helped them in their raids against
the Russians.
</p>
<p>Why did Polotsk princes permit intruders to seize their ancient possessions? Were
no efforts made to drive them out? There were. Prince Vsevolod, assisted by Lithuanians,
advanced to attack Riga, but when he saw from a distance the tower and walls of the
city he turned back. Afterward Vladimir went from Polotsk to Ikeskola. The Germans,
taken by surprise, carried out gifts to him, and he left without interfering with
the city. He went to Holm, but that city could not be taken by surprise. Reinforcements
hurried up from Riga, and Vladimir left, merely taking tribute. Albert, the wily bishop,
expressed no astonishment that the Polotsk prince had come. On the contrary, he explained
that the tribute paid by the tribes to Polotsk was in his eyes a sacred matter. In
the future, he would himself undertake to forward it to Polotsk. Vladimir discovered
that his rights had not been assailed and would not be. As to the Germans baptizing
the Kors, <span class="pageNum" id="pb212">[<a href="#pb212">212</a>]</span>Livs and Chuds, it was done by his permission given to Meinhardt.
</p>
<p>In 1206, Albert, now archbishop, felt the need of further explanations, hence he sent
an embassy to Vladimir. At that time a general uprising was feared. One of the elders,
Ako, was rousing the whole country against the German intruders. It was reported that
the Polotsk prince was coming to assist the oppressed people. In fact many elders
of the tribes had begged Vladimir to aid them. There was a great movement in Polotsk,
and the prince was making ready for a campaign, when the embassy arrived. At the head
of the embassy was Theodoric, with gifts and pleasant words. Vladimir decided to receive
the envoys, but only in presence of the elders, who had come with complaints against
the archbishop. The reception, which began with gifts, came near ending in a hand
to hand encounter. When Vladimir asked why they came, the abbot answered, “To strengthen
peace and friendship.” The elders, on hearing this statement, raised such a terrible
outcry that the prince hastened to end the reception, requesting the envoys to await
his decision.
</p>
<p>Theodoric immediately sent a letter of warning to Albert, and Riga began at once to
prepare for defense; the Grand Master and knights were occupied day and night. Vladimir
heard of this, and lost all hope of seizing Riga by surprise. After consulting with
his warriors, he decided to invite the bishop to Polotsk to examine with him the complaints
made by the elders. He dismissed the Riga embassy, and with them sent his own embassy.
When they reached Kuikenos the Polotsk embassy stopped; only one member of it went
with the abbot to declare the wish of the prince to Albert.
</p>
<p>While the envoys were waiting Albert’s reply, they summoned all who had complaints
to make to meet at Kuikenos. The elders who had been in Polotsk were already there,
and many people came from both sides of the river. The envoys were waiting impatiently
for the bishop, when he sent this haughty answer to their invitation. “Envoys do not
summon ruling personages to whom they are sent, but appear themselves with obeisance.”
The people who had assembled turned now to the Polotsk envoys, asking what they were
to do. The envoys could give no advice. Thinking there was no further help from Polotsk,
the unfortunate <span class="pageNum" id="pb213">[<a href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>adherents of Ako attacked Holm, where they were cut down like sheep. A few of the
insurgents were left alive to form a spectacle in Riga, whither they were driven in
chains to be executed. The archbishop had not considered it necessary to be present
at this battle. After mass, while the abbot was still in the cathedral, a knight brought
him Ako’s bloody head as a token of victory.
</p>
<p>The bishop found it needful to visit Europe often. He had to go to Rome; he had to
make explanations to the Bremen archbishop; he had to see his friend, the Danish king,
who was looking for his share of profit by conversion; he had also to select German
colonists and craftsmen. While he <span class="corr" id="xd32e2003" title="Source: has">was</span> absent on one of these journeys, the people rose up to avenge Ako. They went again
to Vladimir, who consulted with his warriors. “Delay not,” said they; “the blood of
these people will fall on us.” A campaign was decided upon, but the new campaign was
more unsuccessful than the first and brought more woe on the ill-fated people. Vladimir
found Riga strongly fortified. He tried to take Holm, but failed. Suddenly news came
from Riga that a great fleet was approaching. When Vladimir heard of this, he withdrew
from Holm. The fleet was that of the Danish king, who had stopped at Riga, but only
to sail farther. Vladimir, by his weakness, had again brought destruction on the people.
The conversion of the Kors and Livs was now completed to the remotest corner of the
country. All begged for mercy, all promised to accept baptism and the priests. The
kind and faithful pastor pacified his bishopric, until no dissenting voice was heard.
</p>
<p>The bishop raised no question with Vladimir. He acted as though no attack had been
made. But he opened negotiations on another subject. He pointed out that the Lithuanians
were robbers, and quarrelsome, and proposed an alliance between himself and Vladimir.
In 1210 he sent an envoy, Rudolph, to Polotsk on this business. In Polotsk they failed,
it seems, to understand that the alliance was not so precious to Albert as the recognition
by treaty that the two contracting parties had equal rights to carry on and conclude
such a treaty, a recognition, as it were, of his own sovereignty. On one side it was
arranged that the Livs should pay the Polotsk prince an annual tribute, or the Riga
archbishop would pay it for them; on the other side, Vladimir <span class="pageNum" id="pb214">[<a href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>permitted free trade on the Dvina River. Thus did Albert settle with the capital city
of Polotsk, and with its ruling prince.
</p>
<p>As for the petty princes of Gersiké and Kuikenos, they were treated more unceremoniously.
Wenden Castle stood on the high bank of the river Aa, and commanded the whole region.
This castle was the residence of the Grand Master. Vyachko, Prince of Kuikenos, the
unfortunate neighbor of such barons and counts, did not deceive himself. He knew that
his fate was an evil one. The knight, Von Lenewerden, broke into Kuikenos, occupied
the place with his men, declared the inhabitants prisoners, and put Vyachko in irons.
On hearing of this, the archbishop summoned both Vyachko and Von Lenewerden to Riga,
and reconciled them. He restored Vyachko’s property, and persuaded him, as protection
for the future, to have a German guard in his town. Soon after a band formed of Lithuanians
and Kors, occupied in sea robbery, attacked Riga on a sudden. That day Riga hardly
saved itself. The assailants fought desperately. The Riga men, wearied almost beyond
endurance, considered their destruction as certain; but aid came unexpectedly, and
the assailants departed. They made a great fire on the seacoast, threw their dead
into it, and sailed away from Riga.
</p>
<p>At every report of trouble in Riga, the people of the country were encouraged to rise
against their enslavers. Vyachko now rebelled. He sent to Vladimir, the Polotsk prince,
asking him to take advantage of the trouble, and of the absence of the archbishop.
Meanwhile he destroyed the garrison brought into his city. When the archbishop returned
and learned of this act of “his assistant,” as he considered Vyachko, he moved with
the whole Order against “the rebel.” They took everything that could be taken, and
then burned the city. Thus did Vyachko part with Kuikenos, his birthplace. The people
escaped to swamps and forests. Higher up the river was Gersiké. Albert had long threatened
Vsevolod, its petty prince, and accused him of friendship for Lithuanians, saying
that instead of guarding Riga from Lithuanians, he made it easy for them to cross
the Dvina. The archbishop now thought it important that he should take possession
of Gersiké and thus in the eyes of the Livs become their defender against Lithuanians.
The hostility between these people and the Lithuanians, who were related to them by
race, seemed unappeasable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb215">[<a href="#pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>Albert surprised Gersiké. Vsevolod succeeded in crossing the river and hiding in the
forest, but his wife and family were captured; everything of value was taken, and
the town burned. The archbishop was magnanimous; he sent to Vsevolod, saying that
if he wished peace and his family he must come to Riga. Vsevolod went immediately.
He called Albert father, and asked for his family. “I will restore them,” said the
archbishop, “but art thou willing to give thy principality forever to the Riga Cathedral?”
Vsevolod thought that the archbishop meant to rob him, but when Albert explained that
he would give his possessions back as a gift to him, with his wife and children, Vsevolod
agreed to everything. Thus did Germans settle with the petty princes.
</p>
<p>Their success with Polotsk was more than incredible.
</p>
<p>When the archbishop had concluded his treaty with Vladimir of Polotsk, he strove to
form just such relations with Pskoff and Novgorod. His policy was diplomatic and cautious.
He roused the tribes subject to Novgorod by the report that the Germans had come to
free them from tribute. But after Pskoff and Novgorod warriors went through the country
beyond Odempe, and even as far as the sea, all action stopped and the tribes settled
back into obedience.
</p>
<p>Albert now complained more and more to Pskoff and Novgorod of robber attacks upon
commerce from “unruly” subjects of Russia. He said that it was indispensable in self-defense
to put down Tolova and Torma. If he could keep the country in his power, he could
collect and send the tribute to Pskoff and Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Vladimir, the Pskoff prince, liked Riga and the Germans so well that he had given
his daughter to Dietrich, a brother of Albert, but for this friendship the Pskoff
people dismissed him. He then went to Riga, where Albert received him gladly, and
gave him land.
</p>
<p>When Vladimir of Polotsk saw that Pskoff and Novgorod would make no treaty with the
archbishop, he was greatly concerned. He was uncertain how it was best to act against
his insolent neighbor, but at last he decided to write to him touching various questions.
Albert replied that he had nothing against a friendly meeting, but where could they
meet? He could not expect the Polotsk prince to come to him, nor could he go to Polotsk.
Kuikenos <span class="pageNum" id="pb216">[<a href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>now belonged to the lands of the Order. There still remained ruined Gersiké. And in
that city, in 1213, they had a notable meeting.
</p>
<p>The Prince of Polotsk had much to discuss with the master of Livonia. Albert, however,
would not touch upon anything that Vladimir really wanted, and turned stubbornly to
the question of how they were to act toward a common enemy. He proposed that they
act as allies, and pointed out the great good to come from this coöperation. He said
that the treaty already concluded was too narrow; it required broadening. Vladimir
was a simple man and expressed his thought to the wily archbishop with artless words.
On a sudden he said to him: “Wilt thou at last stop baptizing my Kors and Livs; wilt
thou leave my people in peace? They are mine absolutely, not thine. If I wish to baptize
them, I will do so, if not let them remain unbaptized.” The archbishop was astounded.
Appealing to the command of God: “Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them,” he
asked the Polotsk prince which command should be honored, that of God, or of man.
The simple and good-natured Vladimir replied: “That of God,” and said no more about
baptism.
</p>
<p>“Tribute is another thing,” continued Albert. “God himself established that all who
are under authority shall pay tribute to their rulers. Render unto Cæsar the things
which are Cæsar’s.” Recently this tribute had been stopped, but the archbishop declared
that he was not to blame. The Livonians were now begging him to free them from the
yoke of Russia. This was not pleasant for Vladimir to hear. He began with angry words
to threaten. He would burn Riga; he would not let his land be trampled by foreign
intruders; he would level their cities to the earth. The meeting came very near ending
in a battle, and nothing was accomplished.
</p>
<p>After Vladimir’s return to Polotsk, he grew very sad. His warriors said not a word,
but he heard the reproach: “Think what thou hast done in giving the Germans such power.
What answer canst thou render to God for their crimes?” The people were silent, but
the prince saw that they were thinking day and night of how they could avoid falling
into the power of the foreigner. In this sorrow Vladimir continued, till at last every
one was roused and made happy by the great success of Novgorod.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb217">[<a href="#pb217">217</a>]</span></p>
<p>About the time that Mystislav the Gallant came back to Novgorod in 1214, the insolence
of the tribes incited by the archbishop had become unendurable. Mystislav at once
led his warriors into that country, and went twice from side to side through the whole
region. When he had finished the people bowed down to him, and began as before to
send tribute to Novgorod. In 1216 Mystislav left Novgorod, but an example had been
given, and Vladimir of Polotsk recovered his courage. Soon there was at Polotsk an
immense congregation of warriors,—many Russians and a multitude of Livs. The army
was ready to move, but as Vladimir was about to embark he stumbled in stepping from
the shore to the boat, fell into the water, and died suddenly. That ended the expedition.
</p>
<p>Saved from Polotsk, the knights did not escape defeat from Novgorod. They had subjected
again the places won by Mystislav, but Novgorod recovered them.
</p>
<p>With the death of Vladimir of Polotsk, that principality ceased, as one might say,
to exist. In that region Russians and Lithuanians had so assimilated that they were
difficult to distinguish.
</p>
<p>Vladimir was without a successor. After his death, where the German domain ended,
the Lithuanian began. There was now an independent Livonia, and the Germans were seeking
to include that region where they had built the castle of Fellin, a region which the
Danes admired as the Revel coast. This was the Estland, or the Esthonia of Rome.
</p>
<p>After Mystislav the Gallant had shaken the power of the Vladimir principality by the
battle of Lipetsk, and vanished forever from Novgorod, there was an interval of quiet,
beginning with 1218, which greatly favored the Germans in their efforts to obtain
Esthonia. But the Danish king was equally anxious to get possession of this country,
or, according to his biographer, he wanted to purify his conscience from sin and show
his devotion to the Riga Mother of God; therefore he disembarked on the coast of Livonia
a numerous army.
</p>
<p>The Danes and the Riga Germans now did their best to excel each other at baptizing.
Villages and settlements trembled at the appearance of the “cross-bearers.” Wherever
there was a battle the conquerors became executioners, and in retaliation, whenever
a soldier of the cross fell into the hands of the natives, they burned <span class="pageNum" id="pb218">[<a href="#pb218">218</a>]</span>him alive as an offering to their god; sometimes they flayed a cross out of the flesh
of his back before burning him.
</p>
<p>From the castle of Fellin and along the Revel coast regions, the country had gibbets
thickly planted over it. From dread of the terrible sword and gibbet of the intruder,
the people were anxious for baptism. The Riga Germans had many priests, the Danes
only a few; but when the Danes lacked priests they used lay baptism. They collected
the people in a crowd, and baptized them all together. It happened frequently that
when the German knights came, people fell on their knees and cried: “We are baptized
already.” There were cases where the two crowds of missionaries met, and one took
its converts from the other by force of arms. The hatred of the baptizers for each
other became so great that the archbishop went to Rome to complain of the Danes, but
he found there envoys from the Danish king on a similar errand. The Pope confirmed
the Revel coast to the Danish king; afterward, however, the whole land went to Riga.
</p>
<p>The Kors and Livs had not been able to save themselves under the protection of Polotsk,
neither were these tribes protected by Novgorod. In five or six years, that is between
1218 and 1224, their evil fate was settled. During that period princes changed several
times in Novgorod; and the Pskoff men gravely considered in their meetings the question
of making an alliance with Riga. Complaint against Novgorod was general. “Our Novgorod
brothers,” said they, “come to take tribute of rebellious tribes and then go home
quickly; when they are gone we suffer doubly on their account. A bad peace with Germans
is better than such brotherly assistance.”
</p>
<p>At this period Lithuanians were troubled greatly by refugees of their own stock, who
had been driven out of Prussia. These people, urged by the Livonian knights, made
raids against Novgorod. Warring continually with its new enemy, Novgorod was not able
to properly defend its possessions on the coast, and so asked aid of Yuri of Vladimir.
Yuri sent Sviatoslav, his brother, with troops. There was a battle at Wenden, the
knights were defeated, and the castle was besieged, but the Grand Master succeeded
in bringing in reinforcements, and the Russians, satisfied with their booty, withdrew.
</p>
<p>The Letts, who were obedient to the Germans and under their <span class="pageNum" id="pb219">[<a href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>lead, now threatened Pskoff. The whole country about there, called Esthonia by the
Germans, consisted of warring fragments now under German, and now under Russian command.
Odempe, Izborsk, and Yurieff passed from hand to hand. The people suffered from the
Russians because they yielded to the Germans, and from the Germans because they went
back to the Russians<span class="corr" id="xd32e2046" title="Source: ,">.</span> It would be impossible to count all the campaigns and raids of that troubled time.
</p>
<p>The archbishop was hated for his cruelty. Populations whom he came to convert were
filled with terror by his presence; they submitted to baptism, but they washed it
away quickly when he was gone.
</p>
<p>To their assistance came the Novgorod prince, Yaroslav, son of Big Nest. When on his
way to Riga, envoys came to him from the Sea-Fins, from the island of Izel, and begged
him to defend them from the Danes. The country from Izborsk and Yurieff toward Fellin
seemed free of the enemy. It remained to drive the Danes from the Revel coast, strengthen
Revel and build a stone fortress there. When Yaroslav approached Fellin, a fearful
sight met his eyes; traces of the terrible knights were everywhere; villages had been
burned; in places the earth was red with blood; there were gibbets with bodies swinging
from them. The knights had retaken Fellin, and the Russian garrison had been slaughtered.
Yaroslav and his forces went through the country to the sea, approached Kolivan and
besieged the castle of Revel for nearly a month. The Danes defended the place valiantly.
At that stage, Yaroslav took counsel of the Novgorod men, and decided to abandon the
siege for a large tribute in gold. The Pskoff people considered this ending of the
campaign inglorious, and blamed their “brothers of Novgorod” for their selfish conduct.
But even this campaign did not shake the faith of the people in their Russian defenders.
</p>
<p>Yurieff and the country around struggled against the knights till completely exhausted.
While waiting for promised reinforcements from Novgorod, a few Russian champions and
native people fought with the whole force of Livonian knights. This party of brave
men was led by the most insignificant prince of all Russia, that Prince Vyachko, from
whom the archbishop had taken his native place, Kuikenos. His name, however, had <span class="pageNum" id="pb220">[<a href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>acquired great notoriety among the Germans, for he was their most irreconcilable enemy.
From Kuikenos, Vyachko had gone to Yurieff, and there he gave the Germans no peace.
He strengthened the place, and made savage raids on all sides. At last the archbishop
decided, cost what it might, to take Yurieff, that hateful den where all the “malefactors
and traitors” had assembled, as well as many of the bitterest enemies of the church
in Livonia, and where they were commanded by that prince who, from the beginning,
had been the root of all evil.
</p>
<p>The archbishop himself took part in this campaign, bringing with him a multitude of
knights from various parts of Germany. The Knights of Livonia assisted with all their
strength. The place was surrounded and besieged. In addition to the usual engines
of war, the Germans had a movable tower as high as the walls of the city. Under cover
of this tower, they began to dig a tunnel. Meanwhile they entered into <span class="corr" id="xd32e2057" title="Source: negotiaions">negotiations</span> with Vyachko, offering him a free escape with all the Russians, horses and arms,
if he would surrender the fortress and with it the natives who had found shelter within
its walls. Vyachko gave an answer which the archbishop called shameless and insolent,
and in Russian style.
</p>
<p>After the refusal of terms, the siege continued with redoubled force. The knights
complained of the great loss inflicted upon them by the garrison of the fortress,
which day after day, made desperate sallies. At last, fearing that relief might come
to the besieged, the Germans determined to storm the place. Next morning at daybreak,
a fierce assault was made, but it was repulsed. Later on the besieged made an opening
in the wall just opposite the tower, and hurled out blazing stuff to burn down the
structure. The besiegers rushed to extinguish the fire, and in the general excitement
and uproar certain knights made their way through the opening in the wall. Once inside,
they spared no one; a terrible struggle ensued. Meanwhile the place was fired by its
defenders, who had sworn to perish to the last man in case of defeat. The Germans
captured but one man, who later on was sent to Novgorod, with a message that Yurieff
was taken.
</p>
<p>When this messenger arrived, and announced that help was not needed, that all had
perished, there was great sadness in the city, for the warriors were on the eve of
marching to relieve the besieged.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb221">[<a href="#pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not long after this, Pskoff, still fighting with Novgorod, made a friendly alliance
and treaty with Riga. This happened when Novgorod men were continually sending away
Prince Yaroslav and recalling him. It is not to be wondered at that while there was
such internal dissension and disagreement between Novgorod men themselves, and between
Novgorod and Pskoff, the Germans succeeded in Esthonia. Whatever the peace terms were
between Pskoff and Riga, the Germans had become an acknowledged and independent power
on the Baltic coast of Russia.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav, about this time, went to Pereyaslavl on the Alta, and Yuri of Vladimir,
who had married the daughter of Chermny, gave Novgorod to his brother-in-law, Michael.
Thereupon Yaroslav, opposing Yuri, drove Michael from Novgorod, and conquered Chernigoff.
</p>
<p>Remembering how he had been driven from Pereyaslavl by Chermny, Yaroslav occupied
that region which once had belonged to him. Remembering also how on a time he had
been invited to reign in Galitch, he extended his views beyond Kief to Carpathian
Russia. But a slight failure in the South caused him to return to Pereyaslavl Beyond
the Forest, not taking his eye for a moment, however, from Novgorod. Working now against
Yuri, he strove to incite him to quarrel with his nephews, Vassilko and Vsevolod,
sons of Constantine, the first of whom was Prince of Rostoff, the second Prince of
Yaroslav on the Volga.
</p>
<p>Ten years had passed since the death of Big Nest in 1212,—years filled with strife,
disorder and conflict. A second ten years had begun. That which had troubled Russia
in the past threatened in the future, with the end not in sight. And so it continued
until a thunderbolt fell, as it were from the sky, “a punishment for the sins of many
generations, and for all the injustice and lawlessness committed from one generation
to another. The anger which was preparing on high,” as the chronicler says, “and was
delayed by the long suffering of God, burst forth at last.”
</p>
<p>And now comes the period of vast and radical changes in Russia.
</p>
<p>These changes were caused indirectly by the Polovtsi in 1224, who, fearing greatly
the dauntless Mongols, who were attacking them, appealed to the Christian princes.
“They have seized our country,” said the Polovtsi. “To-morrow they will seize yours.”
Mystislav the Gallant, taking advantage of this opportunity to <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>crush a possible future enemy, persuaded other princes of Southern Russia to join
him in aiding the Polovtsi. Basti, Khan of these idolatrous Polovtsi, embraced Orthodoxy
to cement the alliance with the Russians, and the army moved forward without delay.
Upon reaching the lower Dnieper, the Russians, under Mystislav the Gallant, Daniel,
Prince of Volynia, Mystislav, Grand Prince of Kief, Oleg of Kursk, Mystislav of Chernigoff,
Vladimir of Smolensk, and Vsevolod, for a short time Prince of Novgorod, were met
by envoys from the Mongols, who tried to persuade them to abandon the cause of the
Polovtsi, saying: “The Mongols have nothing against the Russians. It is the pagans
whom we wish to destroy. We are as the Russians in that we worship the one God. Profit
by our offer, and avenge yourselves upon the enemy who has warred against you in the
past.” The envoys were seized and put to death immediately, and the Russians continued
their march.
</p>
<p>At the Kalka, a small stream flowing into the Sea of Azoff, they encountered the Mongol
forces, led by two great commanders, Subotai and Chepé. Mystislav the Gallant, Daniel
of Volynia, and Oleg of Kursk, wishing to win for themselves all the glory of the
victory, rushed forward without the aid of the Prince of Kief, and even without warning
him of their intention. The Polovtsi advanced also but when the critical moment of
the struggle came, they were seized with panic, and fell back upon their Russian allies,
thus throwing them into terrible disorder. The defeat was overwhelming; hardly a tenth
of the men under those rash leaders escaped, six princes and seventy distinguished
voevodas were killed. Mystislav of Kief, abandoned by the army, tried to defend himself
in his hastily fortified camp on the banks of the Kalka. The Mongols offered him his
life and the lives of his sons-in-law if he would surrender and pay them a ransom
for himself and his personal following. Knowing well that he could not successfully
contend with the victors, he surrendered. But the Mongols did not regard their promise;
they massacred Mystislav’s men, and putting the three princes under heavy planks,
they sat upon those planks and feasted while the unfortunate Russians died in the
greatest agony.
</p>
<p>After this victory, the Mongols returned to the East, vanished, and were not seen
again for thirteen years.
</p>
<p>Mystislav died four years after that disastrous battle on the <span class="pageNum" id="pb223">[<a href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>Kalka, and sad was the end of his glory. He began a war on Volynia by reason of a
calumny that his son-in-law, Daniel, was trying to deprive him of Galitch,—nay more,
there was a direct accusation that Daniel intended to kill him. These accusations
were brought against Daniel by Bailski. Later on, Mystislav repented and became friendly
with Daniel. He gave rich presents to his daughter Anna, the wife of Daniel, and gave
Daniel his best horse, Aklaz. No steed on earth, as he thought, was the equal of that
one, for had he not brought him alive from the terrible slaughter on the Kalka. Nevertheless
Mystislav betrothed his youngest daughter to the son of Andrei of Hungary, and gave
his son-in-law Peremysl at the advice of boyars in Galitch, chief among whom was Sudislav
“the traitor,” as people still called him. In bringing Mystislav to give his daughter
to the king’s son, these men believed that Galitch would fall to Hungary a second
time, and their efforts were directed toward that object very earnestly. All at once
a report spread that Mystislav the Gallant had decided to go to the lower country
and give Galitch to his father-in-law, Kotyan, a Polovtsi khan. This report was monstrous,
and invented doubtless by tricksters, still Galitch men were so greatly alarmed because
of it, that many left the country and went to Hungary.
</p>
<p>The prince contradicted this lie before all the people. He sent Timofei, his confessor,
to the fugitives; he persuaded them to return, but soon after the king himself came
into Galitch with a numerous army, and insisted that Galitch be given to his son immediately.
Mystislav prepared now for battle. This last battle fought by the hero was as decisive
and brilliant as any which preceded it. The king’s army was crushed. The king himself
fled with maddened mind and shattered body. There was a rumor that this disaster had
been foretold him. “Thou wilt not live, if thou see Galitch,” were the reputed words
of a wizard whom King Andrei asked to soothsay as he was leaving Hungary.
</p>
<p>Mystislav’s allies, Daniel and Vassilko, who fought against Leshko, and did not let
the Poles help King Andrei, brought their regiments to Galitch and strove to make
Mystislav pursue the defeated army. Mystislav was unwilling to do this; Sudislav and
the boyars, not wishing the ruin of the king, in whom lay their great hope, opposed
with all their power; and the war with Hungary ended in nothing.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb224">[<a href="#pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mystislav, weary of the utter faithlessness of the boyars, resolved to leave Galitch.
This resolution delighted the boyars; but they warned him immediately that the hatred
of the country toward him reached also to Daniel, hence they advised him to give Galitch
to the king’s son as a dowry for his daughter. This advice they strengthened by the
following words: “If thou give Galitch to the king’s son as dowry for thy daughter,
thou canst withdraw it later on, should the wish come, but if thou yield now to Daniel,
Galitch will never be thine again.” Mystislav made no answer, but he did as they advised.
He married his daughter to the king’s son and then gave them Galitch, thus acting
as a traitor toward Russia. He withdrew after that, and lived on the Ros in Podolia.
</p>
<p>Daniel, though deceived and disappointed most cruelly, did not utter a word of complaint.
He remained true to Mystislav, and grew stronger and stronger in Volynia. Mystislav
the Silent who admired Daniel greatly, left him the province of Lutsk, but Daniel
had to use force to obtain this inheritance, for not only Bailski but Yaroslav, the
nephew of Mystislav the Silent, raised arms against him. Knowing Mystislav the Gallant’s
affection for these princes Daniel sent his own trusty friend to explain the situation
to his father-in-law, who was glad to communicate directly with Daniel, from whom
he had allowed himself to be separated by false and intriguing boyars. Explanations
made, Mystislav sent a secret message to Daniel: “My son,” said he, “I sinned in not
giving thee Galitch. The boyars deceived me through Sudislav the Traitor. Go with
God’s assistance against them. I will summon the Polovtsi to aid thee, and do thou
move with thy own men. God give thee Galitch, and I will stay here.”
</p>
<p>In this way the old man hoped to repair his shortcomings, but he died soon after in
Torchesk. Aware that death was approaching he begged to see Daniel; he wished to commit
all his house to him, since he had perfect trust in his honesty. The crafty boyars,
however, prevented this meeting, and Mystislav the Gallant died in lonely Torchesk,
without seeing his son-in-law. Of his end it is only known that when he fell ill,
in 1228, he retired to a monastery and assumed the monk’s habit. He left all Podolia
to Daniel, but for this inheritance a general war broke out quickly in Volynia, Galitch,
Kief and Chernigoff, involving all Southern Russia in bloodshed.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MONGOL INVASION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After Vladimir of Smolensk had perished at the Kalka, Vladimir, son of Rurik, who
returned from that disastrous battle, took the Kief throne as the senior prince and
favorite cousin of Mystislav, whose support he enjoyed till the death of the latter.
But no sooner had Mystislav gone from the world than there rose storms of trouble
because of the Kief principality. Vladimir called to mind quickly the offense of Daniel’s
father, who had forced the tonsuring of Rurik. And for this act of the dead Roman
he went now to take revenge on the living.
</p>
<p>As Prince of Kief, Vladimir concluded an alliance with Michael of Chernigoff, and
both began war against Daniel. They would not let him have Podolia, and were jealous
of his claim upon Galitch. Daniel now made an alliance with the Poles, and, since
the chief troops brought against him were Polovtsi, Daniel asked Kotyan, who was his
wife’s grandfather, to put a stop to the war. “Oh, father,” begged he, “stop this
war; take me into thy friendship.” The Khan immediately dropped his allies and made
a movement in favor of Daniel, crushing all that he met on his way. Then he vanished,
and the war ceased of itself, without much injury to Daniel.
</p>
<p>Thankful for this service, Daniel made no use of the Poles, and dismissed his ally,
who had not lost a warrior. Vladimir, son of Rurik, deserted by the Polovtsi, made
peace with Daniel, and soon after begged his aid against Michael. This Michael of
Chernigoff, so recently an ally of Vladimir, was now trying to force him from Kief,
since he greatly desired that ancient city for his own use.
</p>
<p>From 1230 to 1240 war raged throughout Galitch and Volynia, Chernigoff, and Kief.
More than once did Vladimir flee from Kief <span class="pageNum" id="pb226">[<a href="#pb226">226</a>]</span>to be succeeded by Michael; more than once was Michael deprived of his possessions.
All Southern Russia, from the San and the Dniester to the Desna, was the alternate
and fleeting possession of Michael and his brothers, or of the men who opposed them,
namely, Vladimir and Daniel. Each side had its victory, but each met defeat somewhat
later. Daniel brought aid many times to Vladimir. In one of these campaigns the two
men crossed the Dnieper and captured Chernigoff; they warred on the Desna, and captured
many towns in other places. More than once Michael appeared with his troops on the
San and the Dniester. He seized Galitch and left his son and heir, Rostislav, to reign
there. At times Michael gave towns to Daniel; at times he drove him unsparingly from
Galitch regions. At times one of them fled from the other to Hungary, alternately
they were hostile and friendly to each other. Once Daniel and Vladimir were defeated
by Michael and the Polovtsi, which he led in. Vladimir was captured by those same
Polovtsi and could not, for some time, buy his freedom. On the day that Vladimir was
captured a horse was killed under Daniel, who barely escaped with his life from that
battle-field. Then again not only did Michael lose Kief and Galitch, he lost Chernigoff
also. At last Michael was brought to such straits that he begged for peace earnestly,
and made amends to Daniel. “Much have I sinned against thee,” said he. “I have not
held to my promises, I have done great harm to thee, but how many times have I wished
to act otherwise, though unable, for the faith-breaking boyars of Galitch would never
permit me. Now I take oath that with thee I will never have enmity.” So Daniel, with
his brother Vassilko, received Michael as a relative.
</p>
<p>But this happened in 1239, when Michael’s dominions had been turned to a terrible
wilderness, and the city of Chernigoff was a ruin. Up to that ghastly period wars
and dissensions were constant in Southern Russia. During that troubled time Kief was
without a prince really, for it passed from one hand to another so frequently that
the interval during which one prince was winning the place from another was often
far longer than the time he sat on the throne after winning it. Instead of asking
who in that period of unrest ruled Kief, one might better ask who of prominent princes
was not its ruler. The same was true of Galitch. It was difficult to say who reigned
there.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1229 some of the Galitch men, faithful to the people, secretly invited Daniel to
come and rule in their land. At his approach, boyars favorable to Hungary closed the
gates of the city, burned the bridge on the Dniester, and used every possible means
to oppose him. But the people from Ushitsa, Bobrok and Pruth regions marched in from
all quarters to meet the prince “born to them,” and no party had sufficient power
to check them.
</p>
<p>Daniel, forgetting the king’s opposition, and remembering only his personal kindness,
did no harm to Prince Bela, who was Mystislav’s son-in-law. He allowed him to go back
to Hungary, and even went with him to the Dniester. The intriguing boyars bowed now
before Daniel, and only one of them, Sudislav the Traitor, went with the king’s son.
The people threw stones at this boyar, and shouted: “Be off, thou disturber, thou
traitor!”
</p>
<p>The next year, however, a new plot was formed against Daniel, and during the decade
setting in with 1230 conspiracies and disturbances did not cease throughout Galitch.
The boyars called Daniel prince, but seized for themselves everything in the country.
A dissolution of all social bonds and a general decay of loyalty spread with rising
rapidity. Formerly only boyars such as Sudislav or Volodislav, called Red Hair, were
exalted, but now a great host broke in, boyars of whom no man had heard until that
day; notorious were Voldrys and Klimyata, but no one knew of what stock they were.
One Dobruslav seized the whole lower country, though he had no more right to it than
a robber. At the same time a certain Grigory Vassilevitch took the upper part of Peremysl.
A priest’s grandson, one Suditch, plundered actively on every side. Famous also were
Lazar Domajiritch and Ivor Molibojitch, two lawless men of low origin. Such boyars
“made great disturbance and robbed much,” says the chronicler. And these men were
managing the fortunes of Galitch, treating now with Hungarians, now with Poles, and
now with Russian princes. From one side they rushed to another, and again turned from
that one with offers of service to him who could promise the profit at which they
were grasping. In such a condition of Galitch Daniel now lost his heritage, not preserving
one foot of land for himself in all that great region, and then again he returned
to the throne of his father with apparent security.
</p>
<p>The Hungarian king, at the advice of boyars, came sometimes <span class="pageNum" id="pb228">[<a href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>himself, and sometimes he sent his sons thither. Bailski, with his brethren, took
the side of the boyars and rose up in arms against Daniel. Finally Michael of Chernigoff
appeared to take vengeance on Daniel for harassing his land, but, besides this, Michael
remembered the offense against his own kinsmen in Galitch, the vile death inflicted
by boyars on Igor’s sons. There, on the spot where their blood had been shed in the
city of Galitch, he felt it his duty to win back the honor of his family. Hence Galitch
was torn into bits and was ruled at short intervals, now by its own men, and now by
outsiders. More than once intriguing boyars fell at Daniel’s feet and begged mercy,
for the common people adhered to him firmly at all times. At last Bailski ceased his
scheming: “I see myself,” said he to Daniel, “that I can be with no one but thee.”
And then the Poles made peace with Daniel. Next the Hungarian king, Bela&nbsp;IV, made
peace.
</p>
<p>But each success gained by Daniel was followed by the treason of boyars. Now they
conspired to burn him and his brother in their palace; now to assassinate them at
table while feasting. And again they roused Bailski against Daniel.
</p>
<p>Then they summoned in Daniel’s enemies from other regions of Russia, to be followed
by renewed inroads of Poles and Hungarians. Michael of Chernigoff once more entered
into greater friendship with Hungary than with Daniel. He arranged a marriage of his
son, Rostislav, to one of Bela’s many daughters, and maintained a continual alliance
with Poland. Such was the state of affairs during the dreadful ten years which succeeded
1230.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav, son of Big Nest, held Kief as prince in 1237. We know not from whom he received
it, but the place fell to him without a struggle. There were two princes then who
might have claimed the throne, each insignificant,—Vladimir, son of Rurik, who was
still in debt for a part of his ransom to the Polovtsi, and Izyaslav. It may be that
Yaroslav took Kief from these men. He left it on hearing that the city of Vladimir
was destroyed by the Mongols.
</p>
<p>Michael of Chernigoff now took Kief, and put his son in Galitch, but in 1239 he left
Kief because the Mongols had ruined Pereyaslavl and Chernigoff on the Alta, and were
moving against the ancient capital. The Mongols sent envoys to Michael demanding surrender.
The Kief people seized those envoys and slew them. <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>Michael fled straightway. Now from Smolensk came Rostislav, son of Mystislav, but
he was driven out immediately by Daniel, who had at last won Galitch and mastered
it thoroughly. But though Daniel had Kief, he himself did not enter it, but he sent
Dmitri, his boyar, to hold the place.
</p>
<p>Daniel had completely overcome his opponents on every side. He now surpassed all southern
princes, and was stronger than his father had ever been, for he had Kief in addition
to Galitch and Volynia, but this was in 1239, when the dreadful hour was approaching,
and it was too late to enjoy any fruit from the battles and toils which he had passed
through. The very next year Kief was turned into “corpses, and ruins and ashes,” and
Daniel was soon to receive the Mongol command: “Yield Galitch, and level thy walls
in Volynia.”
</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the Mongol tempest was preceded not only by countless wars and
mad quarrels, which produced immense suffering and anguish, but by the appearance
of such omens in the sky and such marvels on all sides that ceaseless terror was born
of them everywhere.
</p>
<p>Beginning with 1224, the fateful year of the Kalka disaster, the whole course of nature
seemed changed throughout Russia. There was an unheard-of dry season, and a hazy heat
with it; pitchy forests were burning and turf swamps were smoking all over the country;
birds had not strength to fly, and fell down inanimate. In the autumn appeared a great
comet; after sunset it lighted up the whole heavens, extending like a long, awful
lance from the west toward the east. There were tales of floods overwhelming distant
places. There were reports also of raging fires. Novgorod burned so that the flames
crossed the river; all thought the end of the city was before them. In Vladimir there
was a fire such as no man remembered. Besides this, there were earthquakes. In Vladimir,
during mass, the holy images in churches began to quiver, the walls of the city were
trembling. In Kief the stone church of the Holy Virgin sank at the corners. More than
once was the sun darkened. Men who knew the movements of heavenly bodies strove to
pacify people by explaining that the moon had gone through the sky, stopped in front
of the sun, and thus hid it. But the sun was affected in other ways; once, while rising,
it was like a small star, and no one could see where its size had gone; then <span class="pageNum" id="pb230">[<a href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>suddenly it appeared in full greatness; another time it sent immense pillars of light
through the skies, which were green, blue and purple. Especially terrible was it in
Kief; from these pillars of many-colored light a fiery cloud formed, which the wind
carried forward till it brooded above the whole city. People fell on their knees and
prayed to the Lord to have mercy; they took farewell of one another, feeling sure
that the end of all life was then near them. The fiery cloud dropped, moved aside,
and fell into the Dnieper, where it vanished without injury to any man. There was
terrible famine in places, above all in Novgorod; there were neither dogs nor cats
left for food in the city; men killed their own brothers and ate them; then there
was pestilence. In Novgorod there were not graveyards to hold all the corpses, and
fences were made around new ones, in which forty-two thousand people were buried.
In Smolensk they laid out four new graveyards; in two of these sixteen thousand were
buried; in the third seven thousand, and in the fourth nine thousand.
</p>
<p>Confused and scattered stories of a terrible invasion were spread among people. From
the East, from the land of the Bulgars of the Volga, came reports of ill-omen, and
then the tale of the “Mongol” became universal. “Oh, that is they!” was heard now
in all places. “It is they who gave the Russian princes that awful defeat on the Kalka!”
</p>
<p>But who these pagans were, no man could indicate. According to report, they came of
impure races hidden away in unknown regions. It was said that there was a prophecy
of old concerning those people which said: “They will come before time ends, and capture
all places.”
</p>
<p>The Mongols burst in from the Trans-Volga regions, through those open spaces called
much later on the steppes of Tamboff and Saratoff, and attacked Ryazan boundaries.
</p>
<p>The Mongol army was enormous for that time. It seemed to the Russians as though a
whole people were moving from one part of the earth to the other. This army was led
by Batu, the great Jinghis Khan’s grandson, the son of his eldest son, Juchi.
</p>
<p>In attacking a region the Mongols surrounded it, as beaters surround game in a forest,
and moved toward a fixed point of meeting. Batu sent envoys to Ryazan, and with them
went an enchantress. The presence of this woman alarmed the Ryazan <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>people greatly. The envoys brought this message: “Give one tenth of everything: one
prince in ten; one man in ten of the common people; give every tenth one from black,
white, brown, and pied horses; from every kind of beast, give one out of ten; and
of all wealth and all products give the tenth part to us.”
</p>
<p>The princes met, and when they had counseled together they sent back this answer:
“When no one of us is living, what is left will belong to you.”
</p>
<p>The Mongols advanced with fire and sword toward the capital. The time was December,
1237, and January, 1238.
</p>
<p>To prevent these invaders from entering settled places, the princes marched out to
meet them in steppe lands. Flinging themselves on the advancing hordes, they fought
with desperate bravery, only to be crushed and destroyed utterly. Ingvar, who was
at that time in Chernigoff, with Kolovrat, a voevoda, seeking warriors and imploring
the Polovtsi to help him, returned home to a desert. Towns and villages were charred
ruins, and contained only corpses which beasts of prey and foul birds were devouring.
Dead princes, voevodas and warriors lay in the frozen grass, snow-covered. Only at
long intervals appeared people, who had been able to hide in the forest, and who came
out now to weep over the ruin of their homes.
</p>
<p>The Mongols not only surrounded the city of Ryazan with an army, but with a wall as
well, and they strengthened this wall in places with firm palisades. This they called
“driving the pig in.” Thus they expressed themselves, delighted that no one could
escape when the city was taken. After they had finished their wall, they put up rams
for battering the city walls in, and prepared ladders for storming.
</p>
<p>The Ryazan men resisted many days, and fought with desperation. They inflicted great
loss on the Mongols, but, as was clear, they were weakening. Since they did not let
their weapons go out of their hands, they were sure to be conquered in the end by
weariness. The Mongols relieved their own storming parties, they gave those men rest,
and sent forward fresh regiments. At last they succeeded in crushing the walls down
and firing the city by hurling in heavy stones and blazing substances. On December
21, 1237, they mounted the breaches, and through fire, smoke and slaughter burst into
the city.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb232">[<a href="#pb232">232</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the same time, in the region about Ryazan, through all villages and monasteries,
similar seizures and slaughters were enacted. For the Mongols it was not enough to
capture cities and towns; they destroyed all the people from the aged to infants.
They amused themselves with inflicting various kinds of cruel death singly; they loved
also to kill men in multitudes. Made drunk, as it were, by abundance of bloodshed,
they rose to a wild, boundless ecstasy.
</p>
<p>For many days this rejoicing and slaughter continued. Then groans and wails ceased
in the ruined city and its environs, and all was silent. There was no one to wail,
no one to groan, since all were lying dead and frozen. When the Mongols had vanished
naught remained but blackened stones and charred remnants. Of many towns, cities and
villages, nothing was left except stones, and cinders and dead bodies. It might almost
be said that the Ryazan principality existed no longer. Those ill-fated princes, when
the Mongols appeared on their southern border, sent to beg aid of Prince Yuri of Vladimir,
and their relatives in Chernigoff. Kolovrat, who had been sent to Chernigoff, led
back some men to the ruins of his birthplace. Amazed and maddened when he saw those
ruins, he rushed forward to strike the rear of the Mongols. He overtook them at night,
as they were leaving the Ryazan borders. The Mongols were terrified when they saw
him. “Are not those the dead of Ryazan,” cried they, “who have risen and come to avenge
their own deaths on us?”
</p>
<p>Those unknown Russians fought like furies. Then, seizing the swords from Mongols slain
by them, and dropping their own weapons, they cut and slashed with more fury than
ever. There was uproar and chaos in the whole Mongol army. The Mongols succeeded,
however, in capturing five of the raging pursuers, whom they took to the Khan, their
commander. “Who are ye?” asked the Khan. “Wonder not, O Tsar,” answered they, “that
we have strength to fill the cup of death for all Mongols. We are servants of Prince
Ingvar; we are of Kolovrat’s regiment, sent to conduct thee and thy warriors with
honor. We conduct as many as we are able.”
</p>
<p>Tavrul, Batu’s brother-in-law, offered to seize Kolovrat. He went out on an unterrified
steed against him, but Kolovrat cut the <span class="pageNum" id="pb233">[<a href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>Mongol in two, from his head to the saddle on which he was sitting. Then the Mongols
surrounded the handful of heroes, who stood like a fortress, and not one of them yielded.
All of those warriors were slain after desperate fighting. The Khan praised the dead
men, and gave the five living their freedom. “The Russians know well,” said he, “how
to drink the death cup with their princes.”
</p>
<p>Prince Yuri gave no aid to Ryazan. He said he would move against the enemy in person,
and act separately.
</p>
<p>The Mongols turned now against Yuri. The old road from Ryazan to Vladimir lay through
Kolomna and Moscow, in a country comparatively rich and well settled. Yuri sent troops
to both cities. To Kolomna he sent his own son Vsevolod, and to Moscow another son,
Vladimir, so young that Philip, the voevoda, was attached to his person. Leaving wife
and family in Vladimir, confident that they would be safe within its walls, he himself
hurried northward to levy warriors, and make ready for action. His nephews from Rostoff
and Yaroslavl, the sons of Constantine, hastened to join his forces, and he hoped
for the return of his brother, Yaroslav, with regiments from Kief.
</p>
<p>The Mongols made no useless delay at Kolomna. They slaughtered the inhabitants and
burned down the city. One of the Ryazan princes, who had survived, joined at Kolomna
the army sent out by Yuri, but in the battle which followed almost immediately every
man fell except Yuri’s son. He escaped by fleeing swiftly to Vladimir, to meet a worse
death in that doomed city.
</p>
<p>A fate like that of Kolomna soon struck Moscow; the place was stormed and sacked.
Philip was killed, with other defenders, who fell fighting bravely. While the Mongols
were dividing the rich spoils and rejoicing, they burned the city. Ordinary prisoners
were killed quickly, those of distinction were crucified, flayed alive or burned.
Yuri’s son, Vladimir, they took with them. The countless army, that same army of which
Arabian historians wrote that on its path “the earth groaned, birds dropped dead,
and wild beasts lost their senses,” opened now and moved away in various directions.
From these divisions still smaller ones separated and marched off on all roads. They
took in towns and settlements as a net gathers fish under water. People fled from
cities and villages in crowds. They hid in caves, in dark forests, <span class="pageNum" id="pb234">[<a href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>and in gullies, not knowing how to escape or whither they should go for refuge. Those
who were near heard from those who had come from afar that Mongols were everywhere
slaying, burning, robbing churches, and cutting down old and young as they traveled.
Others were leading a multitude of captives to their camps. It brought terror to look
at those captives, barefoot and bloodless.
</p>
<p>February 3, 1238, the Mongols appeared at Vladimir and surrounded the city. The Vladimir
men rejected proposals of surrender, and saw with dismay how the enemy strengthened
their camp, and began preparations for storming. Mongol leaders rode round the city
and surveyed its defenses. Then, to the amazement of all, an immense crowd of mounted
commanders approached the main gate of the city, and asked, “Is Prince Yuri among
you?” The people answered with arrows. The commanders replied in the same way, sending
each of them an arrow at the crosses on the bell-towers glittering with golden tops
in the sunlight. Then they made signs to stop shooting and negotiate. When the Vladimir
men desisted, to see what would happen, the Mongols showed Yuri’s young son made prisoner
in Moscow, and asked if they knew him. A cry rose. Vsevolod and Mystislav, brothers
of the captive, wished to sally forth and save him, but they were held back by the
people. All, from the voevoda to the last man in the city, swore to fight while life
remained. All declared that they were ready to die for God’s churches, and those simple
words were no idle sounds from those people.
</p>
<p>The bishops of Vladimir counseled every one to prepare for death and the last hour,
to have this passing life in their memories no longer; and assured them that Christ
would forget no one made worthy through the crown of a martyr. All who heard these
words began to work valiantly. From old to young, every man was to fight on the walls,
or wherever the need was. All armed themselves for the coming storm and the battle.
On the second or third day of the siege, news spread through the city that Suzdal
had been taken, that Rostoff had yielded. Men on the walls saw on the Suzdal road
Mongol regiments approaching rapidly, and then they saw men, women, monks, nuns and
a multitude of people led captive.
</p>
<p>That day the Mongols worked from early morning till nightfall, pulling up timber,
and engines, and planting their wall-crushing <span class="pageNum" id="pb235">[<a href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>instruments. Next morning it appeared that they had not been idle in the night-time.
A wooden wall now encircled the city. For the last twenty-four hours no man in Vladimir
had slept. No person had undressed for a week past. All knew that their city was doomed.
The princes, and Yuri’s whole family, many of the boyars and the people had put on
the monk’s habit, making ready for death with great earnestness.
</p>
<p>On Sunday February 14, 1238, the city was stormed and captured. At daybreak the Mongols
were on the walls, and before midday their work was accomplished. They did not occupy
all parts immediately, though they broke in at once on many sides,—on the Klyazma,
the Lybed, the Golden Gate, and the Valski sides. At one side they made a long mound,
traces of which are seen even to our day. They went up along this mound and came down
inside the walls on their ladders.
</p>
<p>The new city was covered with corpses. In the old city there was a stubborn defense
and great slaughter. Savage fighting went on outside the walls as well. The Mongols
killed every man who tried to escape. Then began the sack of Vladimir. Wherever Mongols
entered, they seized what they found; they stripped the churches, taking everything
of value; wherever they met with resistance, they brought piles of wood and burned
all before them.
</p>
<p>When the enemy sprang in over the walls every person in Vladimir who could carry a
weapon rushed “to drink the cup of death” promptly, knowing well that resistance was
fruitless. The young princes, who thought to break through the enemy, were cut to
pieces. The voevoda, Pyotr Oslyadukovitch, pressed heavily on the Mongols with his
“children,” that is, the whole population of Vladimir, who did not desert him. They
fought fiercely on the walls, and at the walls outside the city, and on all streets
within it. Blood flowed till midday, and not to win victory, for that, as they knew,
was impossible, but to kill as many infidels as they could, and die fighting for the
holy Orthodox faith and for their country.
</p>
<p>The Mongol multitude crushed all before it; numbers conquered everywhere. The new
and the old city were taken by assault, and the capital was burning from side to side
in one vast conflagration.
</p>
<p>Yuri’s princess, with her relatives, daughters-in-law and grandchildren, <span class="pageNum" id="pb236">[<a href="#pb236">236</a>]</span>all the wives and daughters of boyars, many of the people and clergy with wives and
children, and the bishop himself had taken refuge in the Vladimir cathedral. The smoke
and flame of the city’s burning had reached the walls of this edifice, while round
about were heard the shouts of the oncoming Mongols. Those inside the building sought
safety in the galleries. Suffocating from smoke, they would have gone down again,
but there was a dense crowd below pressing upward. The Mongols forced open the door
of the cathedral and, rushing in, seized gold and silver, and all the church vessels.
They cut and hewed down those persons who had not hidden, and those who were trying
to get to the galleries. Then they brought sticks and brushwood, filled the place
well with fuel, and set fire to it. Smoke rose in columns within the cathedral. The
roar of the burning building and the cries of victory from the wild conquerors were
heard in one dull groaning thunder, mingling with the wails, shrieks and prayers of
the dying. The bishop blessed all at their parting, crying: “O Lord, stretch thy unseen
hands to us, and receive the souls of thy people.” The massive walls of the cathedral
did not fall; they withstood the fire and have remained in integrity to our time.
</p>
<p>The horrors of Ryazan were repeated in Vladimir. Only young women, nuns, and strong
laborers were led away captive. The sick, the infirm, the weak and the aged were slaughtered
at once, and without mercy. Smoking ruins alone were left of the beautiful city of
Vladimir. When the Mongols marched away from the remnant of the capital, there was
not a groan, or a cry to be heard from the people, for all who were in that city were
lying dead.
</p>
<p>To overtake Yuri and destroy his forces was no difficult task for the savage invaders.
They found him in Yaroslavl regions, on the banks of the Siti. Among other princes
was Vassilko, his favorite nephew, a son of Constantine, whom his dying father had
asked Yuri to treat as one of his own sons. Crushed by news from Vladimir, Yuri seemed
dazed, and repeated unceasingly: “Why am I left, why do I not die with them?” Grief
for children and wife was swallowed up in his anguish over the destruction of the
city, the people, the bishop, and the clergy. Volunteers who were pouring in brought
similar tidings from every part: “The enemy are slaying all people, burning all places;
they are everywhere!” Only one thing remained: retreat to the distant north. But from
<span class="pageNum" id="pb237">[<a href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>Vologda, and even from Galitch beyond the Volga, came news of the same universal slaughter
and destruction. Three thousand men, sent as scouts to the north, returned with these
tidings: “The enemy are attacking off there, they are around us far and near, they
are everywhere.”
</p>
<p>Soon the struggle began on the Siti, and became straightway a most terrible massacre.
Numbers crushed everything. The Mongols had scarcely begun when they had victory.
Those people who were not mortally wounded, and who rose from the battle field, and
a few who were unwounded fled, and hid in the forests. Yuri, Grand Prince of Vladimir,
lay dead in a great pile of bodies,—his head was not with his body. More terrible
still was the death of Vassilko. The young prince was taken alive by the Mongols.
Attractive in mind and in person, his men said of him that whoso had served him would
not serve another. He pleased also the Mongols. Batu strove to incline him to friendship.
“Oh, dark kingdom of vileness,” answered Vassilko, “God has given me into thy hands,
but thou canst not separate me from Christians.” He would take neither food nor drink
from the pagans. Enraged at his stubbornness, they killed him most cruelly, and threw
out his body to be eaten by wild beasts. The corpse of the young prince was found
in a forest, under the guidance of a woman who said that she had witnessed his tortures,
and Vassilko was buried with Yuri, his uncle. The headless Yuri, as found on the field
of battle, was put in a coffin, but afterward the head was discovered and placed with
the body, and the two bodies were taken later on to Rostoff for interment.
</p>
<p>After the destruction of Vladimir, Rostoff and Suzdal, the whole principality of Vladimir
was ravaged. The lands now included in the governments of Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma,
Tver and Moscow, with a part of Novgorod and Vologda, were scenes of ruin and terror.
Everywhere the same marks of Mongols. Such noted places as Tver, Torjok, Volokolamsk,
Yaroslavl and Mologa were sacked and burned to the ground, as well as villages and
settlements beyond reckoning. The Russians looked on this invasion as a testimony
of God’s anger, such an evil as a flood or an earthquake, irresistible and almighty.
In small villages, when the Mongols appeared, the people grew helpless from terror;
those who could escape rushed away to the forests, secreting their property <span class="pageNum" id="pb238">[<a href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>in the ground; what remained was left to fire and sword. Such boundless woe had never
been witnessed in Russia. The surviving clergy throughout the country called on all
to prepare for the last hour.
</p>
<p>The Mongols cut people down as a mower cuts grass. When they entered a province, they
sent out detachments on every side; like locusts, they destroyed everything utterly.
Monasteries and villages they stripped clean of all things that had value. From stores
of grain they took what they needed, and burned the remainder, boasting that grass
would not grow on their path.
</p>
<p>A great thaw saved Northwestern Russia. In the first days of March, the Mongols, when
within a hundred versts of Novgorod, became alarmed by the swelling of rivers and
turned back. Conducting their countless treasures and urging on long lines of prisoners,
they moved swiftly southeastward to grass-growing regions. On the way they came to
Koselsk, where they met a most stubborn resistance. A detachment attacked the town
for forty-two days, but succeeded in storming the place only after reinforcements
had been sent by Batu, who was enraged at this resistance. It was destroyed utterly,
but its fame will never die in Russian history.
</p>
<p>Before the wooden walls of this city, the Mongols lost four thousand men and three
princes. When at last they burst into the town, they were met by old and young, men
and women, who rushed at them with knives, axes and other weapons, and fought with
desperation from house to house, from street to street. Gradually forced back, they
retired into the Kremlin, or fortress, and fought till the last man perished. Vassili,
the little prince, who was very young, was drowned, it is said, in the blood of the
people.
</p>
<p>The Mongols called this town “Mo balig” (town of woe), the same name which they gave
Bamian of the Kwarezmian Empire, the place at which Moatagan, one of Jinghis Khan’s
grandsons, fell pierced by an arrow, and where the young man’s mother, a daughter
of Jinghis, rushed in at the head of ten thousand warriors and left nothing alive,
not a man, woman or child, destroying even the dogs and cats, slaying everything in
her vengeance.
</p>
<p>After Batu had established himself in the steppes of the Volga, he began to build
Sarai, the capital of his Horde. He cleared the whole country and drove out the Polovtsi.
Kotyan, the Polovtsi <span class="pageNum" id="pb239">[<a href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>Khan, took a remnant of his people, forty thousand in number, and settled in Hungary.
The king gave him land on condition that he and his tribes became Catholic. The rest
of the Polovtsi joined with the Mongols, and from that day they ceased forever as
a people in Russia.
</p>
<p>Pereyaslavl on the Alta and Chernigoff were doomed now, and all who could leave those
two places hurried elsewhere for refuge.
</p>
<p>When winter had again frozen the rivers and put snow on the steppe lands, the Mongols
set out afresh to capture cities and slaughter new thousands of people. Batu sent
a number of his leaders of ten thousand to the north again to search out and finish
all places bordering on Vladimir. This work they did thoroughly in December, 1238,
and January, 1239. Batu, meanwhile, took Pereyaslavl; destroyed the church of Saint
Michael; slew the bishop; killed all who were useless as captives; took whatever belonged
to the people and the churches; and moved on Chernigoff. The walls of that city were
broken in by hurling stones, each of such weight that five men were needed to lift
it. The city was stormed then and burned, the people slain, and every building plundered.
One of the younger princes fell with the warriors. The chronicler states that the
older princes had fled to Hungary. It is true that Michael’s heir, Rostislav, who
had been left by his father in Galitch, and driven thence by Daniel soon after, had
gone to marry King Bela’s daughter. Michael, himself, who at this time had taken Yaroslav’s
place, in Kief, soon found it impossible to stay there.
</p>
<p>When Chernigoff was ruined, Batu commanded his brother to advance upon Kief and make
a reconnaissance. From the Chernigoff bank of the Dnieper he saw the mother of cities
and wondered at its beauty. Envoys were sent to demand its surrender. The Kief people
slew them, and Michael fled from the capital. He went, as he thought, to a safe place,
to Hungary, to be present at his son’s wedding. But, learning of the ruin of Chernigoff
by the Mongols, Bela would not give his daughter to Rostislav. Michael and his son
went then to the Mazovian prince, Konrad.
</p>
<p>Bolder than Michael, Rostislav, a Smolensk prince, occupied Kief, now abandoned by
others. But Daniel of Galitch would not let Rostislav stay there, and seized for himself
the old capital. He did not wait in Kief for Batu; he sent Dmitri, his boyar, to defend
<span class="pageNum" id="pb240">[<a href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>the city. Daniel left even Volynia and Galitch, and went to Hungary. From there he
went to Poland, for Bela himself was struck with such terror that he fled from the
Mongols, and knew not where to find refuge.
</p>
<p>In 1239 the whole Russian land, if not yet under Mongols, looked on that doom as inevitable.
There was such panic terror that men lost proper use of their faculties. All that
interval from December, 1237, when Ryazan was destroyed, till December, 1240, was
a time of destruction and captivity, and the end came only when there was nothing
to destroy, and all the treasures of Russia were in Mongol hands.
</p>
<p>For the people these three years were merged in one unit of time, filled with anguish,
terror and despair. It might be said that they had lost the sense and the power to
count seasons. That Russian land, which in the days of Yaroslav the Lawgiver and Monomach
his grandson had so easily overcome its enemies, and which in the days of Big Nest,
Monomach’s nephew, in spite of all its divisions and conflicts, still preserved some
appearance of oneness, existed no longer.
</p>
<p>On the San and the Dniester there was the same terror of Mongols as on the Desna and
the Dnieper. From the north, from Vladimir, from Novgorod, no regiments appeared,
and none were expected; no prince came with help, and no man was looking for him.
The whole land was as silent as a grave or a desert. The Mongols had not captured
Novgorod, but this was because they considered it as subject to Vladimir. They had
been sated with bloodshed, and looked on the Vladimir region as thoroughly subjected.
To avoid further evil, Novgorod had to connect itself absolutely with Vladimir, and
with it carry the weight of the burden. Besides, the distant north was a country without
attraction for Mongols. Beyond Novgorod lived the Chud people (Fins), whose lands
extended to the shores of the Frozen Ocean. The Mongols did not consider that Novgorod
could be the center of a region dangerous to their dominion, hence they left the old
capital of Rurik uninjured. If they had had reason to punish Novgorod they would have
razed it as they razed Ryazan and Vladimir.
</p>
<p>The Kief campaign was undertaken by Batu on a scale that was enormous; with him went
his brothers and relatives: Kuyuk, son of the Grand Khan, was there, and Mangu and
Baidar, grandsons <span class="pageNum" id="pb241">[<a href="#pb241">241</a>]</span>of Jinghis Khan, also a multitude of famous commanders,—Burundai, Subotai and others.
The whole army consisted of more than five hundred thousand men.
</p>
<p>After finishing with Russia, Batu intended to pass into Hungary and destroy that country.
He had sent a demand for obedience already, and a reprimand to the king for receiving
Kotyan with his Polovtsi, whom Batu looked on as slaves who had fled from their master.
</p>
<p>As soon as the Dnieper was frozen, the army passed over. The Mongol warriors were
so numerous, the squeaking of their wagons so piercing, the neighing of their horses
and the roaring of camels so deafening, that men in the city could not hear, as was
declared, what they said to one another. First the attackers surrounded Kief; next
they built a wooden wall; then they erected their engines and hurled immense stones
at the city walls day and night without ceasing. The mother city was defended bravely
by its citizens, but available warriors were few; for so short-sighted had the princes
been that even when the enemy was on the march they had continued to struggle for
succession. When the Mongols had made sufficient breaches in the walls, they rushed
through and began a hand-to-hand struggle. The Kief men fought desperately. From morning
till evening the battle raged, but toward night overwhelming numbers conquered, and
the Mongols held the walls of the city. That night the Kief men made a new wall in
front of the first one, even women and children assisting in building defenses, and
next day the battle continued. From every house, church and monastery people came
out, and fought to the death in all parts of the city. In the churches, multitudes
had gathered, and from the weight of the people and their effects on roofs and in
the galleries the walls fell. Many perished in hand-to-hand conflict; others were
suffocated with smoke; but none surrendered, for all knew that but one fate awaited
them.
</p>
<p>For several days in succession the slaying of people and the destruction of buildings
continued. The Vladimir Church fell; the Sophia Cathedral, built by Yaroslav the Lawgiver,
endured best of any; the body of that church remained sound, and there is one uninjured
part of the wall, on which is an image of the Virgin, preserved to the present. Of
the Catacomb Monastery, the ancient church and walls were destroyed; of the Golden
Gate, built by <span class="pageNum" id="pb242">[<a href="#pb242">242</a>]</span>Yaroslav, only ruins remained. The more violently the people defended the remnant
of their city, and fought out their last hour, the more joyously did the destroyers
carry on the destruction. They slew old men and children to the last one. If in other
cities they had taken pleasure in general slaughter and devastation, they took tenfold
more pleasure now. The strong places and the sanctuaries of a city were never overthrown
with such fury, and never were the Mongols so relentless as in Kief, the city of churches.
The destroyers did not spare even tombs; they forced them open, and with their heels
crushed the skulls and broke the bones of the ancient princes. The havoc was so great
that during the entire fourteenth century which followed, and in the fifteenth century,
a large part of the city remained a desert covered with refuse. The remnants of stone
buildings which had stood for centuries sank into the ground, dust drifted in over
them, and then was concealed all those ruins. Of that Kief which, in the days both
of Yaroslav the Lawgiver and Monomach, was compared by travelers with Tsargrad, there
remained only the memory. It fell December, 1240, and was never renewed in its former
magnificence, even to our day.
</p>
<p>The defender of Kief, Daniel’s boyar, Dmitri, was brought half alive before Batu,
who repeated these words of praise: “The Russians know well how to drink the cup of
death.” He gave him his life, and took the hero with him in his campaign against Volynia
and Galitch. The boyar, continuing to serve his prince, strove to lead the Khan from
ruining Galitch. He advised him to go quickly and take vengeance on the King of Hungary
for harboring Kotyan and his Polovtsi, saying: “It is time to go against the Hungarians;
unless thou go now they will gather great forces and exclude thee forever. Their land
is a strong one.” Thus spoke Dmitri to Batu, while, in mind, he was weeping over Galitch.
</p>
<p>Batu was the more willing to hurry forward to Hungary, since he had learned that Michael
of Chernigoff and Daniel of Galitch had gone to that kingdom. This, however, did not
change his plan, though it may have hastened its execution, for the campaign against
Galitch and Volynia was notable for swiftness. Batu on his way took through falsehood
Ladyjin, a town which fought stubbornly and refused to yield. He promised the people
in case they surrendered <span class="pageNum" id="pb243">[<a href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>to spare them and their town. At last they respected his word and surrendered. He
slew every man to the last one. Kamenyets he passed, because its position seemed impregnable.
Vladimir, the capital of Volynia, he took by assault and spared not one person. Galitch
he treated in the same way.
</p>
<p>Moving from Vladimir of Volynia along the Būg, the Mongols advanced only as far as
Brest. There, near the edge of Lithuania, Batu halted. The great swampy forests troubled
him and his warriors, and he resolved to turn back. As one more example of cruelty
after so many, they destroyed Brest and slew all the people. Then they moved southward.
</p>
<p>One division of Batu’s army entered Poland in 1240, ravaged the province of Lublin,
and returned with great booty to Galitch. The Mongols reappeared in that country,
however, in winter, crossing the Vistula on the ice, but after advancing to within
a few miles of Cracow, they turned again toward Galitch, loaded with much spoil and
driving before them a multitude of captives, among whom were some of the first people
of Poland. They were pursued by Volodmir, the governor, who surprised them near Palanietz,
and killed many. Discovering how small the attacking party was, the Mongols turned,
made a furious charge, and put them to flight; then they continued their march. Soon,
however, they reëntered Poland with new forces. The nobility of Sandomir and Cracow
assembled their warriors and advanced to meet the oncoming Mongols, but in the conflict
which followed, they were defeated with great loss.
</p>
<p>Boleslav&nbsp;IV at this time occupied the throne of Cracow. Fearing to remain in the citadel,
he took refuge with his family in a castle at the foot of the Carpathians, and later
on in a monastery in Moravia. Many of the aristocracy of Poland followed his example,
escaping to Hungary or Germany; the common people sought refuge in the forests, swamps
and mountains. The conquerors entered Cracow, March 24, 1241, and set fire to the
city, which they found deserted; then they marched toward Breslau, the capital of
Silesia, devastating the region through which they passed.
</p>
<p>On reaching Breslau, they discovered that it had been reduced to ashes by the inhabitants,
who had taken refuge in the citadel with the garrison. The Mongols, after investing
the fortress for several days, raised the siege and joined another corps of their
<span class="pageNum" id="pb244">[<a href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>army to march with it against the forces assembled near Lignitz, where Henry, Duke
of Silesia, was commander of about twenty thousand men. The Mongols were led by a
prince (in Polish chronicles called Péta) whose army far outnumbered that of Duke
Henry. The defeat of the Poles was complete. Henry fled from the field with but four
of his officers; retarded by the fall of his horse, which was wounded, he mounted
a second, but was surrounded, captured, and his head cut off. The Polish loss was
heavy. It is told that to discover the number of the enemy killed, the Mongols cut
an ear from each corpse, and with those ears filled four large sacks.
</p>
<p>They now moved forward, carrying fire and blood even to the frontiers of Bohemia and
Austria. While one part of Péta’s army besieged Olmütz in Moravia, several corps of
it plundered and devastated the surrounding region. Sternberg, commander of Olmütz,
made a successful sortie from the citadel, killed some three hundred of the enemy,
and returned in safety. A few days later the Mongols raised camp and marched toward
Hungary to join the great army under Batu. It was evident that they had besieged Olmütz
only for the purpose of pillaging the country round it.
</p>
<p>Before marching into Hungary, Batu had written to King Bela, demanding that he yield
obedience to the Mongol sovereign if he wished to save his own life, or the lives
of his subjects. Bela paid no heed to this demand, and the only measure of defense
he took was to send small detachments to hold the passes of the Carpathians.
</p>
<p>There was much dissatisfaction with King Bela, for he had no military ability; another
cause for the dissatisfaction was that he had received Kotyan, the Polovtsi Khan,
and allowed him to settle, with some forty thousand families, in Hungary. The acquisition
of this number of subjects increased the power of the king, and the hope of converting
the pagans to Christianity gave him pleasure. But these Polovtsi were so displeasing
to the people that in 1240 Bela had to convoke an assembly of the clergy, and the
nobility of his kingdom as well as the chiefs of the Polovtsi. It was then resolved
that the Polovtsi should be dispersed in different provinces, and should be assigned
uncultivated districts where they could pasture their flocks and herds. Kotyan was
baptized, <span class="pageNum" id="pb245">[<a href="#pb245">245</a>]</span>so also were his chief officers. Still the hatred of the people continued.
</p>
<p>Batu penetrated into Hungary by the pass called “Gate of Russia,” and was joined by
divisions of his army which had been devastating Poland. Thence he marched toward
Pest, and, camping half a day’s journey from that city, he ravaged the country. The
people, thinking that Kotyan, the Polovtsi Khan, was secretly communicating with Batu,
murmured against the king and demanded the death of Kotyan and his men. They attacked
Kotyan, who defended himself for a time, but was at last overpowered and killed. This
murder only served to increase the woes of Hungary. The report of it spread to the
country, and the peasants fell on the Polovtsi and massacred them without mercy. But
those who escaped united and later on avenged their people.
</p>
<p>When the Hungarian army had assembled the king marched out of Pest to meet the Mongols.
The result of the conflict was most disastrous for the Hungarians. The king owed his
escape to the swiftness of his horse. He took refuge near the Carpathians, where he
encountered his son-in-law, who was also seeking an asylum in that country.
</p>
<p>While these events were passing in the heart of Hungary, Kadan advanced through Transylvania,
seizing property, profaning churches, and leading away captives.
</p>
<p>The Mongols remained inactive during the summer of 1241, but in December of that year
a detachment crossed the Danube and pitched their camp near the city of Strigonia,
or Gran. The besieged destroyed all that was most valuable, killed their horses, and
retired into the stone edifices to defend themselves. The Mongols, furious at loss
of plunder, were careful that no person should escape. They seized and burned the
principal inhabitants over slow fires, to make them declare where they had hidden
their riches.
</p>
<p>At this moment news came to Batu of the death of Ogotai, the Grand Khan, and with
the news an order to return to Mongolia at once.
</p>
<p>The barbarians had penetrated even into Austria, and a corps advanced to Neustadt
near Vienna, but retired on learning of the approach of a large army. After the destruction
of Strigonia, Kadan was sent with a detachment against King Bela. Bela, <span class="pageNum" id="pb246">[<a href="#pb246">246</a>]</span>who had taken refuge in Austria, retired with his family to Agram in Croatia, where
he remained during the summer. Learning that Kadan was marching toward Agram, he went
to Spalato on the Dalmatian coast, and then to Trau. Kadan marched with marvelous
rapidity. Halting for a few days at Sirbium River, he assembled the Hungarian prisoners
whom he had seized on the march, and had them all put to death. On arriving at Spalato
and learning that the king was not there, he advanced at once to the neighborhood
of Trau, and camped upon the bank facing the island in the Adriatic where Bela had
taken refuge. There the Mongols remained through the month of March, and then, after
pillaging Cattaro, Suagio and Drivasto, and killing every man, woman and child who
fell into their hands, they returned by way of Herzegovinia and Serbia to join Batu.
While on the march Kadan received orders to hasten, as all Mongol princes had been
summoned to Mongolia.
</p>
<p>Daniel and Vassilko, on hearing that Batu had left Hungary, delayed for a time in
returning to Russia. They knew not where their families were, or indeed if they were
living, and their delight was unbounded on finding them. On the way home from Poland
they could not draw near Brest, because of the terrible odor of corpses. Very little
remained of the former Vladimir, and the ruined churches were filled with dead bodies.
</p>
<p>Batu, who had brought terror on all Europe by the destruction wrought in Hungary,
Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Moldavia and certain portions of Poland, was not pleased
with those lands. The West was too narrow for a nomad people, and Russia became the
real province for Mongols. Hungary and Poland suffered little in comparison. Batu
pitched his tents and built Sarai, as has been stated, on the bank of the Lower Volga,
from where it was convenient and easy to send troops in every direction, and keep
conquered Russia in obedience. The Golden Horde, as thenceforth men called the Khan’s
residence in Russia, was noted for wealth even in Batu’s day.
</p>
<p>Jinghis Khan, who died in 1227, was succeeded by his eldest son Ogotai, who reigned
from 1229 to 1241. During that reign, Batu completed his conquest of Russia.
</p>
<p>Russia, subject now to the Mongol, learned that a new sovereign had appeared in Mongolia,
but Batu, the grandson of Jinghis <span class="pageNum" id="pb247">[<a href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>Khan, remained their ruler. To him was given entire control of the “Kipchak Horde,”
his possessions extending from a line somewhat east of the Ural Mountains to the Danube.
He now counted all the Russian land as his property, and declared to its princes that
they might not live on the Khan’s land unless they bowed down to him.
</p>
<p>Thus began the heavy yoke of the Mongols, which was to last for more than two hundred
years.
</p>
<p>Mongol law touching subjects was brief, being this, in substance,—that not only their
families and property, but their lives were entirely at the Khan’s disposition. This
law, universal, fundamental, unchangeable, was applied to all conquered regions. It
was inevitable to give each year one tenth of the harvest and one tenth of every kind
of increase. Every man was liable to military service with the Mongols against whomsoever
they might send him. Bashaks were appointed in every large town to see to the accurate
fulfilment of these duties, and to keep in obedience both people and princes. At first
princes left in power by the Khan were bound to appear at the Horde with yearly tribute;
besides they were summoned whenever the need came. They must appear with bending knees,
and bowing, and striking the earth with their foreheads. They were forced to give
special gifts to the Khan, to his wives and his courtiers.
</p>
<p>When coming before the Khan, various ceremonies had to be observed. For instance,
when entering his tent, each man had to cross the threshold without touching it; if
he touched it death was the penalty. But before being admitted to the eyes of the
ruler, princes were obliged to go through many trials by wizards. They were forced
to bow to fire, to bushes, to the shades of dead Khans; to pass between two fires
while the wizards and witches who lighted those fires pronounced incantations.
</p>
<p>As this bowing to bushes and fire and the shades of dead rulers took place before
pictures on felt and on silk, it seemed like bowing to idols. They had also to praise
Mongol customs, to drink liquor made of mare’s milk, and eat of Mongol dishes. The
least show of repugnance or indifference involved peril. But, since effect was felt
keenly by Mongols, kindness and terror alternated. They knew at the Horde who the
men were from whom they must withhold honor, and to whom honor ought to be given.
Rulers of <span class="pageNum" id="pb248">[<a href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>regions under Mongol dominion, but remote from Sarai and bordering on lands which
were free, were received more politely than those who were nearer. The following has
been stated by a man who observed the position in Batu’s day: “The Mongols take less
tribute from those whose lands are remote from them, and border on others which are
free, and from those whom they fear for some reason. They treat those remote subjects
more kindly, so that they may not attack, or that others may obey with more willingness.”
The cruel and savage Batu was sometimes fond of charming those princes who bowed down
before him, and of showing magnanimity in treatment, and at such times he seemed the
most kindly host possible.
</p>
<p>Though all Russia was under the Mongol, the yoke weighed with greatest burden on the
lands in the center; that place which was the real heart of Russia, and had formed
the principality of Vladimir. It was unspeakably more difficult for Yaroslav to manage
than for princes in Volynia and Galitch. After Kief had been swept from the earth,
so to speak, or crushed into it, and Batu had shown no wish to take Hungary or Poland,
Galitch and Volynia, as being nearest those countries, were in the easiest position
of all the principalities in Russia.
</p>
<p>Batu, in his first campaign, did not touch Smolensk in its western portions, and in
the second he did not go beyond Brest in a northern direction. In the princes of Volynia
and Galitch he had his last representatives. On the west was the country which for
their own reasons the Russians represented to Batu as little dependent on their rule,
in fact a foreign region, and purposely they called it not Rus, but Litvá. Thus of
all Russian princes, the position of Daniel was most favored with reference to the
Mongols. As to his rival in Chernigoff, Prince Michael, his possessions might have
been called non-existent. Chernigoff and Kursk were in the worst position possible,
because nearest the Mongols. Hence after the conquest, Daniel and Michael were, each
in his own way, distinguished beyond other princes in Russia.
</p>
<p>Daniel knew not from childhood what rest was, and only in years of ripe manhood, after
endless toil and great effort, did he secure Volynia and Galitch on the very eve of
the Mongol tempest, to appear next in a fateful position from which he found no issue
whatever. His principalities, which comprised the borderland of <span class="pageNum" id="pb249">[<a href="#pb249">249</a>]</span>Southwestern Russia in the days of Kief supremacy, were attracted to the ancient capital
from the earliest, but as the Russia of Kief times existed no longer, and as Northern
Russia had been turned into a Mongol possession, the ruler of Volynia and Galitch
had to do one of two things: either compact his lands into a new and special body
and stand apart from the rest of Russia,—alone he could not stand, for he would be
obliged to associate himself willingly or unwillingly with his western neighbors,
the Poles and Hungarians, and, as they were in close connection with the Holy Roman-German
Empire, he might not stand apart even from union with that power (he might be forced
to join Rome, the Latin communion),—or he had the other issue: to recognize and strengthen
the ancient bond of Volynia and Galitch with the remainder of Russia, with that Russia
which had begun in Rurik’s day in Novgorod, and which was baptized in the Dnieper
under Vladimir. But in this case, he would have to suffer Mongol captivity with it,
and sacrifice his own land for the benefit of the common, much suffering country.
He would have to cling to the princes of the house of Vladimir, who had been turned
into slaves, and bear with them the same bitter burden which they were bearing. His
Orthodox feeling forbade him to join Rome and the West. But to join the other Russian
princes and the rest of the Russian people in their subjection to the Mongols was
also beyond his endurance; his pride could not brook that, so he languished all the
rest of his life in a position without escape and without moral refuge.
</p>
<p>Hungary and Poland, crushed by the Mongol invasion, were saved only because those
countries were too narrow for the nomad Mongols, who wanted the freedom of movement
and the space which existed in Russia. But the Hungarians and Poles, proud of their
safety, though defeated and led away captive in every encounter with Mongols, explained
the affair in another way: the West was no longer afraid of a Mongol invasion. Rome,
which had tried in the time of Daniel’s father to bring “the kingdom” of Galitch to
the Latin religion, did not cease now to point out to Daniel, with pride, the freedom
of the West from Mongol subjection, and to promise that if he would obey the True
Mother he would have a right to the same freedom. The Pope explained to Daniel that
the only means of saving his country from that <span class="pageNum" id="pb250">[<a href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>slavery which had been put on it because of its schism, was “to return” to the bosom
of the Mother. He promised in that case the assistance of Poles and Hungarians and
the whole Roman Empire, and offered at the same time a crown and a kingly title. Daniel
refused the title and the crown, but asked very earnestly for the military assistance.
He asked that Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, Poland, and all who obeyed the Holy See,
should be roused to a general attack on the pagan Mongols. Rome summoned all nations
against the Mongols, and to Daniel came assurance that aid from the West would not
be slow in arriving.
</p>
<p>Of Russian princes Daniel alone reigned a number of years without a summons from Batu
to visit the Golden Horde. He had paid no tribute and had not been to the Khan with
obeisance. But the promised aid from the West came not, and in 1250 envoys arrived
from Batu, who repeated the message sent to other Russian princes: “It is unbecoming
to live on the Khan’s land, and not bow down to him.” To this was added: “Give Galitch.”
</p>
<p>Daniel might give Galitch, withdraw to the depth of Volynia, and be satisfied with
half his inheritance; besides the country beyond Brest was unconquered. But after
praying earnestly, and counseling with his brother, Daniel said: “I will go to Batu.”
</p>
<p>When Daniel reached Kief, he saw dreadful misery. He prayed to the Archangel Michael;
he implored the monks to pray for him, and then sailed down the river to Pereyaslavl.
Hence he went directly along by Mongol stations toward the Golden Horde, and he grieved
greatly when he witnessed the pagan ceremonies in the Russian land. In places Orthodox
for centuries, men worshiped fire, bowed down to the sun, moon, earth, and dead ancestors.
Beyond the Volga and near Sarai, he was troubled still more when he heard how at the
Horde they would force him to pagan observances. By that time most other Russian princes
had been at the Horde, and the Mongols declared that not one of them had violated
the ceremonies established for receptions. One of the officials said to Daniel: “How
great is Prince Yaroslav of Vladimir, but no exception was made for him. He bowed
to the bushes, and thou wilt bow.” Daniel spat, and said: “The devil speaks through
thy lips. God close them to guard me from hearing such utterances.”
</p>
<p>But Batu, in addition to saving Daniel from all that might seem <span class="pageNum" id="pb251">[<a href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>like the worship of idols, greeted him pleasantly, and with unusual kindness. When
the prince, led into the Khan’s tent, bowed in a way that seemed to humiliate him,
Batu said: “Daniel, thou wert long in coming, but thou art here and thou hast done
well to come. Thou art ours now. Take our drink.” And they brought him a goblet. The
prince emptied it and bowed, repeating the commonplace words which all princes uttered
on similar occasions: “God gave thee power. I obey thee through God’s will.” He bowed
again, and begged to salute the Khan’s consort. “Go,” said Batu, and he added when
Daniel was about to leave, “Thou art not accustomed to milk; drink wine.” And when
he was taking farewell of the Khan’s wife, they brought a goblet of wine to him from
Batu. They detained Daniel at the Horde a shorter time than was usual for princes.
After confirming all his rights in Volynia and Galitch, they dismissed him with courtesy.
</p>
<p>Great was the delight of Daniel’s family when he returned to them unharmed. His success
was mentioned on all sides. That summer the King of Hungary sent this message: “Take
my daughter for thy son Lev.” The king feared Daniel because he had visited the Horde,
and besides, on the San, he had beaten the king’s son-in-law and expelled him from
Galitch. When the wedding took place Daniel restored all captive Hungarians. Thus
he and the king became friendly. Roman, another son of Daniel, married Gertrude, a
daughter of the late Duke of Styria. Roman now claimed Styria as the dowry of Gertrude.
The King of Bohemia, whose queen was a daughter of the same duke, also claimed this
inheritance.
</p>
<p>Daniel, with Boleslav of Poland, Bela’s son-in-law, campaigned against the Bohemian
king. He did this to make friends in the West, and thus get rid of the Mongols. He
tried to induce his western neighbors to join him, and for this purpose he entered
their circle of action. But from beginning to end, every promise of aid proved futile,—empty
sound, nothing more. The Pope saw very well how fruitless were his efforts. Not only
in Germany, but in Hungary and Poland his messages were unheeded. At last Daniel left
papal promises unanswered. Then a legate was sent to deliver the crown to him and
anoint him king in Western fashion. It was not the first time that they had come to
Daniel for this purpose, but he had set them aside with various excuses. For example,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb252">[<a href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>he had said earlier to the legate that it was no time for coronation when his lands
were in danger,—not a crown did he need, but strong warriors. But now the papal envoy
found Daniel at the place and time most convenient for his object, namely, at Cracow,
on the way from Bohemia to Galitch, surrounded by his allies after a victory and the
capture of a city.
</p>
<p>He refused this time also, saying: “I am in a foreign land.” But the papal legate,
Polish princes, and magnates urged Daniel to take the gift offered. His mother, a
Polish princess, insisted also and helped to influence him. “The Pope respects the
Greek Church,” said the legate, “and curses all men who offend it. He is about to
call a council to unite the two Churches. Aid will come from the Pope very quickly.”
The Polish princes promised with every solemnity, and their magnates promised with
them, that after Daniel had taken the crown they would march against the Mongols.
</p>
<p>In 1253, Daniel was crowned in Drogitchin. His subjection to Rome was complete, as
it seemed to Polish princes. But, breaking all solemn promises, neither Poles nor
Hungarians made a move to march against the Mongols.
</p>
<p>The following year Batu, who had been watching, and understood perfectly Daniel’s
problem, sent an envoy renowned for his keenness, with a command to raze and destroy
every fortress in Volynia and Galitch. Never had he commanded the Galitch prince so
decisively, as if to show the world that he knew the situation and was master of it.
Daniel, understanding well that no opposition could serve him, withdrew to Volynia,
and sent Vassilko, his brother, and Lev, his own son, to meet Burundai, the keen envoy.
“Raze your fortresses!” said Burundai. And all were destroyed at his order. The walls
of Vladimir in Volynia, though of wood, were so strong and immense that there was
no chance to tear them down before the coming of the envoy, hence they were burned
by Vassilko immediately. Such promptness was praised by Burundai, who even dined with
Vassilko on that day. But when this envoy departed, another one came, who said: “Burundai
has commanded me to level your entrenchments.” “Accomplish the command,” said Vassilko.
Baimur and his men filled every trench, and leveled all the earthworks surrounding
the walls of Levoff, a city which Lev himself had founded, and which was called after
<span class="pageNum" id="pb253">[<a href="#pb253">253</a>]</span>him. Burundai now ordered both princes to make a campaign with him. Adding to his
own men warriors from Volynia and Galitch, he attacked Lithuania; then he took Vassilko
against Poland and visited the districts of Sandomir and Lublin.
</p>
<p>With such a turn of affairs, Daniel had cut off all relations with Rome; he was therefore
not a little astonished on receiving a new reprimand from the Pope for his lack of
obedience to the Holy See. To this he made no answer.
</p>
<p>Not loving Galitch, the capital with which were connected so many memories of boundless
deceit and disturbance, Daniel founded Holm, a new capital, and built a number of
Orthodox churches. Thenceforth he passed his life in sorrow, for his position was
one without issue. He was in a charmed circle without power to solve the riddle of
his condition; he could look at it with terror, but he could not escape from it. In
Holm he died in 1266, and was buried in the church of the Holy Virgin which he had
founded. The honor Daniel received from Batu wounded his spirit so that his words
touching this were recorded: “Oh, worse than woe is honor coming from Mongols.” A
similar blow had he received at Drogitchin, through that gift of a crown bestowed
with deceit and in spite of him.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">MICHAEL OF CHERNIGOFF</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Michael of Chernigoff wished to show how a Russian prince could bear himself when
in despair over the ruin of his country, and when he felt that a Christian could not
live under Mongols. Unlike his family, Michael was not noted for mental endowments.
He had been ambitious; he had sought power as keenly as others and more than once
had begged pardon of Daniel, saying that he had not kept his oath; but, with all his
human failings and weakness, he preserved in his soul with more vividness than many
the testament, “I am a Christian.” He had been in some ways distinguished. To begin
with, he was an only son, and, according to family tradition, a son given in answer
to prayerful entreaties. He and the wife of Yuri of Vladimir, that princess who had
perished in the burning church and the blazing city, were the two children of Chermny.
In addition to general weakness, he had suffered since childhood from a seemingly
incurable disorder, which subjected him to marvelous illusions. He sought relief in
vain and was unsparing of outlay. The greatest physicians of that time were powerless;
no help could be found for him. At last, by the prayers of a saint, he was freed from
the disease. He was cured by a miracle before age settled down on him.
</p>
<p>Michael heard that in Pereyaslavl Nikita, an old man, was living on the top of a pillar,
and was saving his soul there. The prince took with him two intimate boyars and some
attendants, and went to that land beyond the forest. Never had he been so troubled
with hellish attacks, never had they so tormented and overcome him as when he was
nearing the place where Nikita was winning salvation. He had dreadful visions, and
when awake he was as if demented. The boyars who were sent to Nikita to inform him
of Michael’s arrival, received from the saint a staff <span class="pageNum" id="pb255">[<a href="#pb255">255</a>]</span>with the command to give it to Michael. The prince took the gift and from that hour
he was freed from his trouble. He went to the pillar serenely, and a blessing was
given him. On the place where his tent had stood and where he was cured, the prince
erected a cross, and wrote on it the date of his recovery, May 16, 1186. A chapel
stands on that spot to-day. He gave liberal gifts to the Pereyaslavl monastery, and
returned home to be well ever after.
</p>
<p>If, to such peculiarities of Michael in youth, we add other traits, they are those
forms of his kindly disposition which touched even the hearts of the stern men of
Novgorod, when he was prince in their city. They never forgot that when they crushed
Michael’s enemies, who were partisans of Yaroslav, son of Big Nest, Michael did not
let Novgorod drown one of those persons in the Volkof, or inflict death upon any man.
Besides, the prince did not take any property from men whose effects were subjected
to seizure; he persuaded Novgorod adherents not to divide for their own use the goods
of the guilty, but to use them for the public good. Later on those men boasted that
they had taken nothing, but had used all to build a second bridge in the city at the
persistent advice of Prince Michael.
</p>
<p>In 1245 this only son of Chermny, and grandson of Sviatoslav, “the sister’s son,”
was in such a position that the fate of other princes could not be compared with it
for hopelessness. Through nearness to the Golden Horde his inheritance was a part
of the immediate possessions of Batu, and, speaking correctly, Michael had nothing
left to him. His wife, a sister of Daniel and Vassilko, had found a refuge with her
brothers; the husband of his only daughter, Vassilko, son of Constantine of Vladimir,
had been killed most cruelly, and later his widow became a nun in Suzdal. All of Michael’s
near relatives had lost their lives mercilessly. His only son, Rostislav, was more
a cause of suffering than of pleasure. As has already been stated, he was betrothed
and about to marry a daughter of King Bela. Michael went to Hungary to be present
at the marriage, but the king, upon hearing that Chernigoff was utterly ruined, changed
his mind very quickly, and father and son found it well to leave the country.
</p>
<p>Michael felt bitter pain in his heart at this proof of the falsehood and selfishness
of mankind. But when the king himself had been <span class="pageNum" id="pb256">[<a href="#pb256">256</a>]</span>struck by the Mongol tempest, he changed his mind and agreed to the marriage. Whether
Michael consented this time or not, he did not go to the wedding. Still, out of love
for his son he could not refrain later on from a journey to see the young couple.
He experienced then a new sorrow and a suffering far greater than that which had struck
him the first time, for King Bela and his son both turned from Michael: the first
from his daughter’s father-in-law, the second from his own father.
</p>
<p>Having lost all in this world that was dear to him, Michael returned to the ashes
of Chernigoff, accompanied by only one faithful person, Feodor, his intimate boyar.
Each now took an oath to the other that he would give an example of how men will die
if there is Christian faith in them. This was at the time when Batu had declared to
all Russia that he considered its subjection accomplished, and invited the princes
and common men who had fled and were then in concealment to come back to their places,
and live as was proper for subjects. Up to the time of that declaration towns, hamlets
and villages were deserted. Men had settled down to live among wild beasts, and were
hiding wherever concealment was possible. When this announcement was made by Batu,
the people returned to the ashes of their dwellings, and the princes explained to
them what would now be their duties. Those of the princes who were left assembled
from all parts of conquered Russia and went to Batu at the Horde. There they begged
him for the power which had so recently been their own. And to each who bowed down
before him in submission, and according to Mongol ceremony, the Khan gave the place
which seemed good to him.
</p>
<p>Michael did not go to the Horde to get power in Chernigoff. He had no desire now for
the deceits of this transient existence; he went to lay down his life among Mongols,
but he wished to so die that his death would be a sermon to Russia, and strengthen
the souls of all Christians. He said to Ioann, his confessor: “I wish to stand with
him before Batu,” and he pointed to Feodor, his boyar. “Many go to that place and
accomplish the will of the pagan,” replied Father Ioann. “Being tempted by this world’s
deceitful glory they walk between fires, they bow down before the sun, trees, and
other objects. Do that not, O Michael, but declare before pagans that it is a sin
to worship things created.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb257">[<a href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>“With the aid of thy prayers, holy father,” said the prince, and the boyar, “as is
pleasing to God, so will it be in our action. We wish to shed our blood for Christ’s
holy teaching.” Ioann blessed them for their high undertaking, and added: “If ye will
appear as new martyrs in our wild, sinful century, do this for the strengthening of
people.” With faith and with many exhortations, the priest gave them additional communion
bread to take with them, to use in case of need, and blessed the two men for the journey,
saying: “May God give you strength, and send His holy Spirit to uphold you.”
</p>
<p>When Michael reached the Horde, and announced his arrival, Batu commanded the wizards
and witches to present him in the usual way. They led the prince and his boyar toward
the Khan’s residence, and soon they saw a multitude of people, Mongols, Russians and
others. Some were bowing to fires and bushes; others were muttering words and looking
at the sun, or gazing at the fire. Women were whispering toward the fires and throwing
into them chips of food, scraps of cloth, silk, and satin, bits of down, and little
bundles of fur plucked from costly peltry brought as presents to the ruler. All things
brought as gifts were first made pure by this ceremony of burning. Then the wizards
told those to be presented to the Khan how they should pass between the two fires
and be purified.
</p>
<p>Wizards now came to Michael and Feodor and asked them to approach. But when they neared
the fires and saw people passing between them, Michael halted. “I think,” said he,
“that we ought not to follow.”
</p>
<p>The wizards urged. “We are Christians,” answered Michael, “and will not worship any
created thing. We will not go between your fires, and will not bow down to idols.”
These bold words put an end to the pending presentation. The two men were led aside
and left in peace.
</p>
<p>Batu, when informed of this refusal to conform to established ceremonies, sent to
persuade Michael with kindness. The Mongols knew how to soften orders by decreasing
ceremonial so much that disobedience would seem simply stubbornness. Batu sent a man
of high degree named Eldage, who had great power of persuasion. “Why offend the Khan?”
asked Eldage. “Is anything difficult demanded?” But Michael would not bend to idols.
“Why not <span class="pageNum" id="pb258">[<a href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>carry out the Khan’s directions?” continued Eldage. “Only refrain from offending him
and thou wilt be honored; thou wilt receive thy principality. Whoso will not bow to
the sun is not worthy to look at it. Why not bow before fire? Preserve thy life; receive
thy principality. If thou wilt not carry out the Khan’s orders, think what will happen
to you.”
</p>
<p>But Michael was immovable. “Because of our sins, God has given us to you,” said he.
“Say to the Khan from me: ‘I bow to thee, O sovereign, because God has given rule
to thee and this world’s glory, but I will never bow to that which these people are
worshiping.’ ” “Let it be known to thee,” broke in Eldage, “that thou hast lost life
already.” “I am willing to die for Christ,” replied Michael.
</p>
<p>But even after this, Batu gave some chance for pardon. Many Russians now came to Michael
and endeavored to change his decision. Most important of all was Boris, his own grandchild,
his daughter’s youthful son, the first born of Vassilko, son of Constantine, and grandson
of Big Nest. The Russians began imploring and persuading Michael not to risk life
for mere ceremony. His grandson fell at his feet. “O my father, my lord, bow down,
do the will of the Khan,” begged he, weeping. “God himself sees,” added the boyars
of the young prince, “that thou art constrained and not acting of thy own will. Would
He take account of such an action?”
</p>
<p>“I do not wish to be a Christian in name,” replied Michael, “and yet do the deeds
of a pagan.” The boyars denied not the sin, but they took it from him. They said that
since he had given a promise to suffer for Christ they would take on themselves that
promise and obtain pardon. The young prince clung to his grandfather; he begged, he
implored, and wept. Eldage saw with pleasure that Michael was weakening, and said
nothing further. But Feodor, the boyar, fearing lest Michael might falter at sight
of those who were imploring and weeping, led him to one side and spoke thus to him:
“Remember the words of Ioann, which he took from the Gospel: ‘Whosoever will save
his life shall lose it.’ Remember also the words: ‘Whoever shall deny me before men,
him will I also deny before my father, which is in heaven.’ ”
</p>
<p>All surrounded Michael again, and again they entreated. “No, no,” answered Michael;
and on a sudden he loosened the sword <span class="pageNum" id="pb259">[<a href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>from his side and hurled it to a distance. Then he slipped from his shoulder the princely
mantle and threw it away from him, saying: “Take the glory of this world, I want it
no longer.”
</p>
<p>Eldage’s delight became anger, and turning in rage to Michael, he said sternly, “Life
or death, choose now between them!” Those were his last words. “I am a Christian,”
replied Michael. “Go and say to the Khan that I will not go between fires, I will
not bow down to idols.”
</p>
<p>Eldage walked away, leaving all in deep sorrow. Michael and Feodor read the psalms;
those who were near made the sign of the cross with them. No one used arguments now.
Men saw how Michael and Feodor took the communion bread which they had received from
the priest Ioann, and brought with them.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the people cried, “They are coming! they are coming!” A party of horsemen
rode up. These were the men sent to kill Michael and Feodor, who were repeating aloud,
“Thy martyrs, O Lord, who have not rejected Thee, suffering for Christ’s sake, undergoing
many torments.” The executioners rushed at Michael, stretched apart his arms, and
throwing him to the earth backward, they fell to beating the old man with fists on
the breast and near the heart, with much violence. When he was half dead they turned
him face downward and jumped on him, stamping with their heels till life left him.
They had to murder him with blows, and not with the sword, since that was the Mongol
method with princes. The corpse was then decapitated by one of the Mongol spectators.
This man proved to be a thief and a renegade from Russia, who had gone over to the
enemy. He whispered afterward to the boyar: “Bow down and thou wilt live. Perhaps
they will give thee Michael’s dominion.” Feodor made no answer, but turning to the
executioners he said: “I am ready to follow my prince.” And he was killed also.
</p>
<p>It was the Mongol custom to give the bodies of their victims to the dogs to be eaten,
but the multitude of Russians living at the Horde gathered them nightly, when the
dogs were loosened, and prayed above them. Thus the bodies of the martyrs were saved,
and taken to Chernigoff, where they rested till Tsar Ivan Vassilivitch wished to have
them. The bodies of Michael and his boyar are now in the cathedral of the Archangel
Michael in Moscow.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2 class="main">RUSSIA UNDER MONGOL RULE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After Yuri’s death on the Siti, in 1238, the Vladimir throne of Dolgoruki and Big
Nest was taken by his eldest brother, Yaroslav. Yaroslav thought of his birthplace
in that splendid time when his father’s power covered Russia, and his capital, with
its magnificent edifices, was considered as the chief of all cities. In his youth
he had shared with Yuri, his brother, in the deeds and humiliation of that time when
the first place among princes was won by Mystislav the Gallant, who took the Vladimir
throne and gave it to their eldest brother, Constantine, after that prince had been
deprived of seniority by Big Nest, because of disobedience. In manhood Yaroslav had
worked with Yuri at one time, at another against him, in Chernigoff and Novgorod.
He had ruled in Pereyaslavl; he had ruled in Novgorod many times in succession, and
in Kief more than once.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav’s previous life had passed, not merely without fruitful action, but even
in action which dimmed his reputation. It had passed in barren wars, which were for
the greater part the mere wanton, fighting amusement of princes. Only in riper years,
when, in time of bitter slavery, he held the throne of Vladimir under Mongols, and
when he had passed through the woe of the Russian land in common with all people,
did he redeem his past errors and receive that respect which made his name memorable
and won for him that love which he could not obtain earlier.
</p>
<p>When Yaroslav returned to Vladimir the people met him with grateful tears and a touching
delight, with prayers to the Almighty and with thankfulness. All saw in him now a
prince who had suffered with the people, and a still greater merit was this,—that
he was ready to suffer with them in future. Everything that had happened before the
Mongol tempest seemed now very distant, <span class="pageNum" id="pb261">[<a href="#pb261">261</a>]</span>a past gone forever, but a past with its terrible relics. What Yaroslav had seen while
returning to Vladimir was ghastly to look at and remember. He had passed through places
worse than a desert. Vladimir was one half destroyed, one half charred and blackened.
There were dead bodies everywhere,—in the streets, in the houses, in the churches.
Yaroslav’s first task was to cleanse, to clear out and purify, to bury the dead; clear
away the ruins; summon the people from forests and dens of concealment; to struggle
with hunger, which threatened to increase, and with pestilence, which follows closely
on hunger; to restore order; and begin anew to establish that which had been created
by generations of labor and had been lost in that one Mongol horror.
</p>
<p>Novgorod, which had survived, owing to the fact that the Mongols considered it a part
of Vladimir, now by necessity became more nearly connected with the capital; besides
the destruction and ruin of Southern Russia had greatly affected Novgorod by barring
the road to princes from Kief or Chernigoff. Above all, by a marvelous provision,
Alexander, son of Yaroslav, rose now among princes, and his immense work in those
days of anguish strengthened Northern Russia and saved it. When Yaroslav in 1237 undertook
to reign in Kief, he seated in Novgorod his son, Alexander, who later on was famous
for his victory on the Neva, which gave him his second name, Nevski. Though Alexander
became Novgorod’s favorite, that city could never live long in peace even with the
best of its princes, and Alexander thought more than once of leaving the place. In
1240 he went away with his mother, the daughter of Mystislav the Gallant, his wife,
and his court to Pereyaslavl Beyond the Forest. Then when at the city’s request Yaroslav
sent his second son, Novgorod wanted Alexander back. At that time the Mongols attacked
anew, wasting Murom and towns on the Klyazma. There was terror again in every place,
so that no man knew how to save himself. Then envoys from Batu came to Yaroslav, demanding
his presence with the tribute of Vladimir. Yaroslav, doing all things demanded, went
to the Horde with Constantine, his son, and some boyars, taking with him the tribute.
Batu received his declaration of obedience with courtesy and commanded that he call
himself Prince of Kief. “Be the head of all,” said Batu, and Constantine Batu sent
to bow down before the Grand Khan in Mongolia.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb262">[<a href="#pb262">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>Constantine spent more than a year and a half on his journey. After Yaroslav had submitted
to Batu, the other princes followed his example. The Khan confirmed those subordinates
and the Mongol yoke was established, with all its burdens increasing in weight as
each year came.
</p>
<p>The tribute was not appointed at first with precision, but the Khan declared that
he would send men to arrange all things, and describe the Russian land. It would be
evident then what the income would be for each principality.
</p>
<p>When in 1245 Constantine returned from Mongolia, where he had found favor with the
Grand Khan, Batu summoned Yaroslav a second time. Ogotai, the Grand Khan, was now
dead, and in his place Kuyuk, a son of Ogotai, was reigning. To his enthronement went
many vassals, all subject rulers, also Khans, relatives of Jinghis. Batu sent his
brothers to this assembly, but did not go himself. Being sovereign in the Horde, one
part of which was found in Asia, while the other extended deeply into Europe, he thought
himself next to Jinghis, even when that mighty conqueror was living, and now, after
the death of Ogotai, he felt nearer to the Grand Khan than ever. To increase the splendor
of the festival, he sent his vassals to represent him, selecting from all those who
ruled under him only the great ones. Hence he commanded Prince Yaroslav to visit Mongolia.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav, crushed more by misfortune than by his fifty-five years, found it difficult
to endure this long, torturing journey, but he went without murmuring, understanding
well that safety for Russia was to be purchased only by unconditional obedience to
the will of the conqueror.
</p>
<p>Beyond the Caspian were monotonous sand plains. In reaching Central Asia he had to
cross stretches of dry and parched land, waterless regions without inhabitants, where
many of his men died while struggling with drought and great spaces. In the Kwarezmian
kingdom they met ruins of cities; plains covered with skulls, bones and skeletons,
monuments of Jinghis Khan’s terrible slaughters. On these endless expanses, Yaroslav
met legions of many tongued people, all of whom, in common with Russians, were under
the Mongol yoke. Beyond Kwarezm stretched boundless deserts and steppes. Again new
trials and a road unspeakably difficult and exhausting, along which were <span class="pageNum" id="pb263">[<a href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>still other traces of Jinghis Khan’s triumphs. And again and again Yaroslav was met
by the ever present conquerors, commanding subject tribes.
</p>
<p>But all that he suffered on the road seemed as nothing compared with what he had to
see and endure at the Mongol capital. Kuyuk had assembled all subject sovereigns,
so that of rulers and the highest persons near them four thousand were present. The
gifts which those persons brought with them formed whole camps filled with treasure.
Of silver and gold alone there were five hundred wagon-loads. During the time of festivities,
Yaroslav was not merely a witness of feasts, he took part in them. Among guests they
gave him the first place, and distinguished him by a goblet of honor. But that special
“honor” shown Yaroslav was of the kind given when a victor honors the chief among
many captives, and from this honor he died somewhat later.
</p>
<p>At the end of the festivities, when Yaroslav had taken farewell of his hosts and was
on the eve of departure, he died suddenly. Considering the place, no one thought his
death natural. Each man of the Horde knew well from observation that whoever came
there depended on fate for salvation. There were so many Khans and Khan’s wives and
they had so many relatives that it was hard to please all, nay, impossible. No man
could answer this question: “Have I succeeded?” No man could discover the springs
through which decisions were made and brought to fulfilment.
</p>
<p>It was noised about in the Horde that Yaroslav had been poisoned. Some thought that
the Mongols did not like his strong influence at home, and would not let him go back
to Vladimir; others said that his own relatives had calumniated the Grand Prince to
Batu, and Batu had written about him to Kuyuk, that stern-faced and marvelous Mongol,
of whom it was said by his intimates that no man had ever seen a smile on his face,
or heard a jest from his lips. This Grand Khan had been gracious to Yaroslav, but
it was whispered most cautiously that Kuyuk’s mother, Turákina, had given Yaroslav
a cup of honor with her own hands at parting, and poisoned him. His faithful boyars
brought back his body and buried it at the side of his brother, and of Big Nest, his
father.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav was not distinguished for civil, or military exploits. He was not renowned
for one of the great deeds <span class="pageNum" id="pb264">[<a href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>in history, but his name became memorable and is honored to this day in Russia. In
him men saw the first prince who, insulted by pagans, bowed with humility before a
Heaven-sent misfortune, and who did not fall into despair through empty pride, or
through personal haughtiness. They saw in him not a conquering prince, but a man who
with suffering and grief bowed down and beat the earth with his forehead before the
savage Mongol, in order to save Russian people. His image was fixed in the national
mind as the image of one who had suffered for Russia, as a prince whose lot it was
not to magnify himself, but to endure insults for the sake of those under him. In
the popular mind, he was the first of those men who humbled themselves to save others.
</p>
<p>At that time all Russians looked on Mongol subjection as a terrible misfortune, as
something that could not be avoided in any way. It seemed at first to be the fate
of the country. Nothing bright or gladsome could be seen ahead for ages, no light
of salvation, even in the distance. Captivity, the yoke, the Mongols, such was the
cruel period which began when Yaroslav had reached advanced manhood. In addition,
they gave this as praise to him, that he had inspired in his children, especially
in Alexander, the same kind of fortitude in suffering, and had left as a testament
to that son to seek salvation for the people through devotion. This thankful memory
of the prince, who had given the first notable example of humility and firmness in
misfortune, lived in his descendants for generations.
</p>
<p>When the great-grandsons of Yaroslav had lived at last to the hope that God would
free the Russians, they honored more than their fathers had the memory of their great-grandfather,
the sufferer who had died in Mongolia, who had in his day, with much weariness, warded
off ruin from Russia.
</p>
<p>In the terrible time of Russia’s captivity under Batu, Yaroslav’s son, Alexander,
the favorite son of Feodosia, daughter of Mystislav the Gallant, appeared next as
the savior of Russia. He had before his father’s death become celebrated for discretion,
for magnificent valor, for victories and for kindness even to enemies. He was unbending
and severe only to crime and disobedience. One of the most noted knights of the West,
who was sent by the Livonian Order to confer with Alexander, said on his return: “I
<span class="pageNum" id="pb265">[<a href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>have traveled many lands, and seen many sovereigns, but such a man I have not met
thus far.” Batu in his old age at the Golden Horde, said, after he had received Alexander
Nevski: “The truth has been told me; there is not another prince like Alexander.”
</p>
<p>Nevski was never defeated in battle, and never made any man his enemy. But this was
the wonderful trait in him; neither among princes nor other men was any his equal
in humility. The Mongol yoke was a terrible test of submissiveness and endurance.
When the Mongols had strengthened themselves, and had become firmly established, the
yoke became the more difficult to carry. The people believed that it had been inflicted
by Providence, and looked on it as a punishment for the injustice of many generations,
but no man understood this belief of theirs so well, and felt the consciousness of
Russia, as did Alexander Nevski. The younger princes were too inexperienced, too proud
to comprehend the position, and bend to it. The strongest of these, Daniel of Galitch,
blushed for shame at being tributary to the Mongols, and instead of meeting them with
humility, took measures which were useless and vain, measures which ended in nothing.
Alexander’s career as a prince began in his childhood. In 1228 he was first made prince
in Novgorod at eight years of age, when his father was disputing with Michael of Chernigoff.
Later on he was prince in Novgorod a second time, when his father returned to the
ruins of Vladimir. By being in Novgorod, Alexander was undoubtedly saved from the
sword of the Mongol.
</p>
<p>In 1238, when eighteen years old, Alexander married a Polovtsi princess. From the
wedding feast he was forced to go to the banks of the Sheloni, where there were many
and bloody attacks of the Chuds, urged on by the Germans of Riga, and led by them,
aided also by Lithuanians at the direct and indirect instance of the Knights of Livonia.
These attacks became more and more threatening, and at last were insufferable. Alexander
defeated those invaders, but at this time new enemies showed themselves,—the Swedes,
who strove to rouse the more eastern tributaries of Novgorod, and to fix their power
in the Chud regions, where St. Petersburg now stands.
</p>
<p>The Mongol yoke, in addition to other evils, roused all the enemies of Russia to greater
activity. The Livonian Knights put aside every ceremony, and their haughtiness went
beyond bounds. <span class="pageNum" id="pb266">[<a href="#pb266">266</a>]</span>They seized for all time, as they thought, the lands named by them Esthonia, and threatened
to take Pskoff and even Novgorod. The Pope demanded from Waldemar of Denmark, the
destroyer of Wends, and from the Swedes, too, a campaign against the “faithless Ruthenians.”
He demanded the subjection of Russian lands bordering on Sweden, so that all might
be brought to the one true religion.
</p>
<p>In 1240, when the Mongols were marching on Kief, Swedish ships entered the Neva and
closed the old Russian way to the Baltic. The Chud tribe, Ijora, long subject to Novgorod,
was defenseless; the Swedes claimed the whole country. The Swedish king’s son-in-law,
Birger, sent this message to Alexander: “If thou hast courage, come hither; I have
taken thy land and am occupying it.”
</p>
<p>Novgorod lands were now in great peril and a cry of discouragement rose throughout
the city. Novgorod regiments were summoned immediately, and the city sent to Yaroslav
of Vladimir for assistance. But Alexander would not wait for reinforcements; he was
satisfied with the moderate forces of Novgorod, and was ready to set out at once.
After mass in Holy Sophia, the bishop went to the square with Alexander and blessed
him for action. Then the prince said to all, in the words uttered on that same square
by Mystislav, his grandfather: “God is not with might, but with justice.”
</p>
<p>The Ijoras greatly feared Swedish supremacy; this fear gave them strength in the encounter,
and the Swedes, though they outnumbered Alexander’s men, were defeated decisively.
Alexander himself did not leave the battle-field all that day of July 15, 1240. He
was in the most dangerous places, guiding every movement of the army, and left the
mark of his own weapon on Birger’s face. Night saved a remnant of the Swedes, who
sailed away in the darkness. So the fame of Alexander sprang up in that dreary time
of Mongol captivity, in that day of general suffering and helplessness, and his countrymen
of the South and East, crushed in spirit and on the verge of despair, found some consolation
in the fact that their brethren of the North had been led to victory by their prince,
who alone had success in that time of trial. After this battle the people surnamed
him Nevski (of the Neva) in reward for his bravery and this great victory, the anniversary
<span class="pageNum" id="pb267">[<a href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>of which was for three centuries celebrated throughout Russia with solemn memorial
services.
</p>
<p>But if the Swedes were forced to give peace for a time, the Germans of Riga had no
wish to respect the boundaries of Novgorod. The Livonian Knights acted as pleased
them along the Pskoff borders, and roused subject tribes against Novgorod whenever
they found it possible. Soon after the battle with the Swedes, Nevski, as now we may
call him, could not agree longer with Novgorod, hence he retired to Pereyaslavl with
his wife, his mother, and attendants. The complaints made by Novgorod were those made
against all Vladimir princes, namely: “They wish to connect Novgorod lands with their
own, and that is impossible. What has gone to the Vladimir prince is his, and what
is of Novgorod belongs to Novgorod. In Volok and Torjok, for example, the princes
were to maintain one half the tax-collectors; one half were to be appointed by them,
and one half by Novgorod, but they manage all the work with their own half. The princes
entice Novgorod men in numbers to go to Vladimir, and in Novgorod places they settle
Vladimir men. Besides, they acquire villages by purchase and by gifts, and in exchange
they take in their own names, and in the names of their princesses, villages belonging
to Novgorod. They permit their followers from Vladimir, and their other favorites
to act in the same way. Places in Novgorod which have been assigned to the princes
are managed by Vladimir men, and not men of Novgorod. Such things must not be!”
</p>
<p>Another part of those complaints was regarding meadows given up for the personal use
of the princes, their hunting and fishing grounds, and bee places. It was also asserted
that the prince built his own towns on Novgorod land; that he governed, judged and
managed Novgorod without considering the posadnik; that he took places from Novgorod
men and gave them to outsiders without consulting the posadnik. In view of all these
accusations and quarrels, Nevski refused to govern, and left the city.
</p>
<p>The Livonian Knights had seized Pskoff, where that most disorderly son of a disorderly
father, Yaroslav, son of Vladimir and nephew of Mystislav the Gallant, was active.
He had been taken prisoner once and sent captive to Pereyaslavl, but was freed somewhat
later. With him were associated certain Novgorod traitors, who were in Pskoff, and
these men now, for the second time, went <span class="pageNum" id="pb268">[<a href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>over to the Germans of Riga. By the help of such traitors, the Livonian Knights not
only got possession of Izborsk and Yurieff, but of Pskoff also, and those deserters
were rewarded by being made posadniks and managers. Now the Germans demanded children
as hostages from the loyal Russians of Pskoff, from fathers of families, and those
children were taken to Riga. When they were, as they thought, firmly settled in Pskoff,
the knights roused those Chud tribes which they controlled and broke into Novgorod
regions. Already they had conquered the two tribes connected with Novgorod, and had
erected a fortress, Koporia, at Lake Ladoga.
</p>
<p>Novgorod men turned, with a prayer for assistance, to Yaroslav of Vladimir, asking
him to send his son Alexander to them. But Nevski refused with decision, so Yaroslav
sent Andrei, a younger son. To others enemies were now added Lithuanians, who ravaged
in various directions south of Novgorod, while the Germans with their Chud subjects
came within thirty versts of the city. They seized all the cattle and horses, so that
earth-tillers had no animals to work with. The Novgorod men sent to Yaroslav a second
time, saying: “Give thy son Alexander, we pray thee.”
</p>
<p>Their prayer was heard. Nevski arrived, and all was changed quickly. A good army was
assembled at once. Men of Ladoga, Karelia, and Ijora went under his banners with gladness.
Alexander razed the fortress of Koporia to its lowest foundation, and defeated the
Germans; some he sent as prisoners to Novgorod, others he set at liberty. Strict and
stern judgment reached only those Chuds who had gone over to the enemy. Spies and
men who had given information to the Germans he hanged as a lesson to the others.
</p>
<p>Many persons came then from Pskoff with accounts of the terrible disorder reigning
there. They begged Nevski to free them, not only from Germans, but also from traitorous
Russians. The Germans dissembled no longer. What they had taken, they said, was now
sacredly theirs, and they would never give up what belonged to them.
</p>
<p>In 1241 Nevski occupied all approaches to Pskoff, and then captured the city itself.
The neighboring Chuds, who had deserted to the Germans, he pacified strictly. He took
possession of their country and burned it. Some of the people he cut down where he
<span class="pageNum" id="pb269">[<a href="#pb269">269</a>]</span>met them; others he took captive. Those Russian friends of the Germans, who were posadniks
in various places, he put in chains and sent to Novgorod for imprisonment. The worst
among spies and informers were put to death. The worthless, treacherous Prince Yaroslav,
who was related to Nevski by his mother, humiliated himself and left the enemy, and
Alexander sent him to Torjok to fight against Lithuanians.
</p>
<p>Thus Pskoff was freed from the Germans, and from traitors. The Livonian Knights would
not acknowledge this position and war with them became unavoidable. These knights
of the Sword boasted that with one blow they would end every Russian success; they
would not let the Slav language dominate the German; Nevski would be taken alive to
serve as a spectacle. It was said that the Bishop of Riga himself would appear with
his warriors, and from Wenden and Fellin all the forces of the Order were coming;
that the Danish king was sending assistance.
</p>
<p>Nevski, not wishing a siege in the city, marched out of Pskoff to meet the assailants.
A small detachment of Pskoff men sent forward to forage met such defeat that it brought
all to terror. Their voevoda and others were slain, many people were captured; a mere
handful came back with the tidings that the enemy was near in great strength. Nevski
turned then to the Chud lake, to that spot known as Voroni Kamen (Raven Stone), and
fixed his camp near the cliff there. It was at the end of March, but winter in that
northern country was still in full vigor. The Pskoff lake had strong ice on it and
the whole region about was still snow-covered. The Germans came with a large force.
The whole power of the Order was present, and they brought all their subject tribes
with them. The two armies met on the Pskoff lake. But this time the Russians were
not few in number: new regiments had come. Yaroslav had not left his son unassisted;
Novgorod troops had been sent under Andrei, his brother, and reinforced by these warriors,
Alexander was strong, and all were rejoiced to be under him. Courage was great among
Nevski’s men. “We are ready to die for thee. The day has come to give our lives for
the cause!” said his warriors in one outburst. Alexander had the gift of inspiring
his men with confidence both in him and in their own ability to meet the enemy successfully.
Before the battle he prayed: “Judge, O God, and give sentence between us and our haughty
<span class="pageNum" id="pb270">[<a href="#pb270">270</a>]</span>opponents. O, give us not to suffer from the noisy tongue.” And he made the sign of
the cross. A like prayer was on the lips of all his warriors.
</p>
<p>This renowned battle began on Sunday, April 5, at daybreak. From the vigor of the
struggle and the multitude fighting on both sides it was called a slaughter, and from
the place where it was fought on the lake it was called “the Ice Slaughter.” “The
conflict was stubborn and very venomous,” says the chronicler. “The rattle from the
breaking of lances, and the clashing of swords was as if a frozen sea had broken its
ice and was fighting furiously with the pieces.” The Germans rushed into the battle
confident of victory and proud of their skill. They advanced boldly with their wedge,
which the Russians called in derision “a pig snout,” or simply “a pig.” Pressing heavily
on, they succeeded in breaking through one of the regiments, but Nevski struck the
side of this wedge, bending the rear of it, and the ranks were thrown into confusion;
they had no place of refuge; they were driven seven versts and utterly defeated.
</p>
<p>More than four hundred famous knights fell in this battle; fifty more were made prisoners,
and most of the Chuds were either slain or taken captive. The Master of the Order
fled with a poor remnant of his forces, and, trembling for Livonia and Riga, sent
messages to Denmark immediately, imploring the king to rescue the Holy Virgin of Riga
from the “faithless Ruthenians.”
</p>
<p>All Pskoff went forth with images, crosses, and banners, to meet Nevski. After this
great victory Alexander returned to Novgorod, where envoys from the Order soon appeared
with homage, and spoke thus in the name of the Germans: “We yield Pskoff and other
towns which we have taken with the sword. Prisoners we will exchange for our men whom
you have captured.” Peace was concluded on these terms.
</p>
<p>As Livonia and Sweden belonged to the Latin religion, Nevski’s fame was heard throughout
Western Europe. In Rome at this period they had not for a moment lost sight of one
of Russia’s strong men, Daniel of Galitch, and now they turned sharp attention to
Alexander Nevski.
</p>
<p>Lithuanian raids not only did not cease after Nevski had sent the worthless Yaroslav
to Torjok, but that prince himself came near being captured, while trying to repulse
them. The Tver men <span class="pageNum" id="pb271">[<a href="#pb271">271</a>]</span>joined this prince at Torjok, and suffered a dreadful reverse there. The Lithuanian
bands killed a multitude of men, took herds of horses, and, with animals and prisoners,
hurried homeward. Pursued to Toropets, they seized that place, and, entering it with
all their booty, thought themselves safe behind strong defenses. But Nevski hurried
from Novgorod, took Toropets, seized the prisoners, saved the booty, and killed or
captured all the Lithuanians. Some he slew while attacking the city; others while
they were fleeing. He destroyed eight bands of those invaders, then he dismissed the
Novgorod men and with his own following set out for Vitebsk, where his little son
Vassili lived with relatives of his mother. On the way he came upon many bands of
Lithuanians, which he exterminated. Taking the boy from Vitebsk, he turned toward
Novgorod. On the road to that city he met new bands and crushed them. Seven times
did he crush Lithuanians. After that they feared Nevski and dared not annoy him.
</p>
<p>Alexander, now famous in many countries and nations, had not as yet been troubled
by Batu, who considered him a subject. In this way he had an exceptional position
among all the princes, though he did not hold himself free, and grieved greatly over
the sorrow and suffering of Yaroslav, his father. Still, as a prince of Great Novgorod,
where his palace was near the cross-covered dome of Sophia, he, with the Novgorod
people, could still say: “We have not been conquered by Mongols.”
</p>
<p>At the Horde they were satisfied for the time with Yaroslav’s obedience, and made
no demand on Nevski. But they were waiting for the moment in which to summon him with
greatest emphasis. Only after Yaroslav’s death did Batu’s words come to Nevski: “Does
Alexander not know that God has subjected to me many kingdoms and peoples? Will the
Prince of Novgorod be alone in opposing my lordship? If he will preserve his lands
intact and uninjured, let him come hither to look at my rule in its glory and honor.”
</p>
<p>Alexander in every weighty question of conduct sought counsel from spiritual advisers.
At this time in Russia two men named Cyril enjoyed special confidence. One of these
was renowned for his difficult and peace-bringing labors; he was Cyril, a native of
Galitch, and at that time Metropolitan of Kief and all Russia. The second Cyril was
Bishop of Rostoff, and was then in Vladimir. <span class="pageNum" id="pb272">[<a href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>To this second Cyril Nevski went for advice touching one point: Should he go to Batu
or avoid going? Had he the strength to endure torments which would be inflicted most
surely if he would not reject Christ the Saviour in case they required him to do so?
He did not trust in his own strength completely. Alexander opened his mind thus to
Cyril. The bishop encouraged him to go, and to die if the need came, but to avoid
death were that possible.
</p>
<p>Alexander went to Sarai and met with high favor. His younger brother, Andrei, had
been at the Golden Horde earlier. All then remembered how firm Russian princes could
be on occasions; they had not forgotten Prince Michael of Chernigoff and the way that
he died when his hour came.
</p>
<p>The prompt coming of Alexander pleased the aged Batu, who did not force him to bow
down to the sun or to fire. Moreover, he praised him before his own favorites. Still
Alexander and his brother, Andrei, were commanded to go and bow down to the Grand
Khan in Asia.
</p>
<p>The two brothers, with dismal forebodings, set out on the journey which had caused
the death of their father; they were more fortunate, however, than he, for they returned
to their country uninjured. Each brought with him different impressions. Whether going
or coming, Andrei did not cease to exhibit his hatred of Mongols and his anger at
the general obedience given to that people. “Is it possible that we are to be forever
friendly with pagans, and serve them? Better leave all and escape to other countries.”
So thought Andrei. That this was his mind was shown by his deeds performed later.
Alexander, at every step through the great destructive land of the Mongols, became
sterner and more and more thoughtful, as if he were beholding the sufferings of his
father as he passed through those same deserts and sand plains.
</p>
<p>After an absence of less than two years, Alexander returned, in 1249, with a face
of stern thoughtfulness and an expression which had changed altogether the youthful
appearance of him who had conquered at the Neva and the Raven Stone.
</p>
<p>Where each prince was to reign was a difficult question in Russia at that time. The
will of the Khan, if not the only law, was at least the supreme law for princes. The
old rules were both observed and rejected. The man who found in those rules <span class="pageNum" id="pb273">[<a href="#pb273">273</a>]</span>his own profit sought to make others observe them, but if they obstructed his way,
he tried to ride over them. The Khan could appoint whomsoever he pleased to hold any
place; all knew that very clearly, hence enterprising young princes worked against
their seniors. At the Horde appointments were given not unfrequently through respect
for the ancient Russian law, to which princes appealed in petitions. But if a petitioner
was unable to retain the place given him, the Khan might or might not assist him.
</p>
<p>In a word, confusion was common during the early years of Mongol dominion. Nevski
had no direct reason to strive for the throne of Vladimir. He, like all the sons of
Yaroslav, was second to his uncles, the brothers of his father. Sviatoslav, the eldest
of these, to whom Yaroslav had given Suzdal, was confirmed by Batu as Prince of Vladimir.
But, as if to prove that in this gloomy time every right was confounded, Sviatoslav
had barely assumed power when there appeared among his nephews an unprincipled, ambitious
prince who dispossessed his uncle of the throne and seated himself there immediately.
That was Prince Michael, Nevski’s youngest brother. For his boldness they called him
“Plucky Michael.” But his rule was short, for he was soon killed in battle by Lithuanians.
Being the youngest of Yaroslav’s sons, Michael had not received a large portion,—he
got only Moscow. While guarding this little province he met Lithuanians near the Kaluga,
frontier on the Potva; from that small river his corpse was brought back and buried
in Vladimir.
</p>
<p>This quarrel between uncle and nephew occurred while Nevski and his brother Andrei
were journeying to Mongolia.
</p>
<p>But the death of Prince Michael did not restore rule to Sviatoslav, his uncle, who,
freed from one rival, met another straightway. Nevski would not oppose his uncle,
though he might have done so with some show of justice, for his father, when Grand
Prince, had given Suzdal to Sviatoslav as an inheritance.
</p>
<p>The Vladimir principality came to Nevski as Yaroslav’s eldest son. Though Sviatoslav
had taken Vladimir as against his brother’s children, and had been confirmed in this
by Batu, the “Plucky” had not been slow in ejecting his uncle. Now, after Michael’s
death, Vladimir was princeless. Nevski did not care, as it seems, for Vladimir at
that time, and would not contend for it. Andrei <span class="pageNum" id="pb274">[<a href="#pb274">274</a>]</span>had a different view of the question; he would not yield to his uncle, and strove
at the Horde to supplant him. Batu for some reason found it unjust to return the principality
to Sviatoslav; so he gave it to Andrei. But he remembered that Nevski was older, and
Andrei did not deny the fact, hence the Khan made this decision: let Nevski be Grand
Prince of Kief and at the head of all princes; let Andrei be Prince of Vladimir. Thus,
because of the title given Nevski at the Horde and by his seniority, there were two
so-called Grand Princes in Russia in 1250, but the Prince of Vladimir was the real
Grand Prince, since his was the Grand Principality.
</p>
<p>That such a position was impossible became clear very quickly even to Mongols. But
for the time Nevski was silent, and ruled not in Kief, but in Pereyaslavl, when not
in Novgorod. His heart was too heavy and his soul too greatly tortured to fight about
places with his uncle or his brothers. He would not contend at the Horde with other
princes. He had an important object of his own, though at that time he thought it
not attainable.
</p>
<p>To Novgorod, where Alexander lived mainly, came an embassy from Rome like that which
had once gone to Daniel of Galitch. The envoys were two cardinals of distinction.
The Pope informed Nevski that these men were skilled in speech and fitted to teach
the law of God perfectly. They brought a letter from “His Holiness,” which mentioned
the Livonian Knights and Rome’s ceaseless care in protecting Christian lands from
savage races, and stated that the Pope wished to incline Prince Alexander to receive
the teachings of the Latin Church, and show obedience to the See held by God’s vicegerent.
“The greatest ruler,” wrote the Pope, “is not lessened, but exalted through obedience.
Hence we persuade thee, O prince, to recognize the Roman Church as thy mother, obey
her first priest, and bring all thy subjects to join us. Know if thou take advantage
of our disposition we will exalt thee among other princes to the very pinnacle of
glory.” To convince him the more, the Pope assured Nevski that Yaroslav, his father,
had died in the Latin communion. “From Plano Karpini, our envoy sent to the Mongols,”
wrote the Pope, “we received news that thy father gave obedience to the Church. This
would have been known to the world had not sudden death seized him. In view of that
happy death it is clear that he is in communion <span class="pageNum" id="pb275">[<a href="#pb275">275</a>]</span>with the blessed, a happiness which we wish thee to share with him finally.”
</p>
<p>That Plano Karpini saw Yaroslav in Mongolia is undoubted, for in his writings he describes
the visit to the Grand Prince minutely, and how he knew him, also Yaroslav’s death,
but of this conversion there is not a syllable.
</p>
<p>Nevski received the envoys, but avoided discussion. He informed them that he would
take counsel and give an answer in writing. The Pope was encouraged by the fall of
Byzantium and the rise of Baldwin’s empire, which forced the Patriarch to Nicea, thus
hindering communication between him and Russia, and also through the conquest of Russia
itself by the Mongols. Hence his hope to win the two most important Russian princes,
Daniel of Galitch, and Alexander Nevski.
</p>
<p>Daniel at first roused in the Pope hopes which were not justified later. Nevski on
the contrary gave absolute refusal at the outset, and thus relieved the Pope from
further explanations. He consulted his spiritual advisers and prepared a written answer
stating briefly and clearly: “We know sacred history; we adhere to the teachings of
the Apostles, and the traditions of the Fathers. We follow the seven ecumenical councils,
but we do not recognize your teaching.”
</p>
<p>In his letter the Pope praised Nevski because he had not recognized the Khan. It is
hardly possible that the West knew not of Nevski’s journey to Mongolia, for the Livonian
Knights knew that he had been there, and whatever they knew Rome knew also. Nevski
did not see how peace, power and glory could come to Russia through papal supremacy,
but to hear the Pope’s statement that the West could not think of Nevski as a subject
of the Mongols must have grieved his spirit. It reminded him, who had tamed invading
Germans at the Raven Stone and elsewhere, that he must bear the Mongol yoke on his
shoulders. The gloomy vision was not brightened by the fact that he, a Grand Prince
of Kief, had no domain whatever, and that Andrei, his brother, through whimsical rule
in Vladimir, was ruining power where it really existed. In the Horde itself the friendly
Batu was growing senile, and it was evident to all men who knew the situation that
power was slipping from him. But those eager to rule at the Horde had not yet ventured
on action. Sartak, Batu’s son, was reigning <span class="pageNum" id="pb276">[<a href="#pb276">276</a>]</span>in his father’s name, and though Berkai, his uncle, was threatening Sartak, even with
death, neither the son nor the brother had real power.
</p>
<p>Ulavchi, Batu’s favorite, was the man who managed every affair at the Horde. Whoever
went to Sarai at that period, however much he pleased Berkai or Sartak, could do nothing,
unless first of all he gave presents to Ulavchi, and came to an agreement with him.
Toward the end of his long life Batu became so feeble that for two or three years
before his death no one heard of him; it was as though he had already ceased to exist.
By some accounts he died in 1255, by others two years earlier. It was difficult to
tell who held power at Sarai during that period. No matter where one looked, disorder
was evident.
</p>
<p>In Vladimir, Sviatoslav, the uncle, still struggled with his nephew, and ceased not
his complaints at the Horde. Andrei, that nephew, continued to boast of his hatred
toward Mongols, and to rouse Russians against them. He did not go regularly with the
tribute, and he decreased the sum each time. He disturbed people’s minds; he not only
roused opposition to tax collectors, but, as if to exhibit his feelings, he met them
contemptuously and annoyed them. He did not restrain the expression of popular hatred,
which was great of itself, but strove to excite and extend it. At the Horde the baskaks
made complaint of the prince and were bitterly dissatisfied.
</p>
<p>Andrei blamed Alexander for inactivity, and persuaded their brother, Yaroslav, to
join him and give an example to their elders that they were not to be friends or servants
of the Mongols. (Yaroslav was Prince of Tver later on, and from him came the line
of Tver princes who fought so stubbornly with Moscow.)
</p>
<p>At Sarai the gloomy disorder of the Horde was increasing, and, with the utmost humility
that a man could exhibit in submitting himself to demands there, it was impossible
to get a just arrangement of affairs in Russia. No matter how Sviatoslav struggled,
Mongols paid no attention, for he was poor in comparison with others. But his nephew,
Andrei, when he appeared at the Horde with obeisance, scattered gold before those
whom he found there of use to him. Notwithstanding all his keen hatred of Mongols,
he even exchanged hospitality with the most important ones, that is, with those who
“had influence,” and the complaints raised by tax collectors against Andrei were left
unconsidered.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb277">[<a href="#pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus passed one year of his reign, and the second began, which for him ended badly.
It was reported that they were ready at the Horde to settle with Andrei severely.
A detachment of Mongols, commanded by Nevruya, was sent to Vladimir, and the meaning
of such a military promenade was well known to all Russians. The following was the
Horde statement concerning the prince: “Andrei has no fear in his heart; he offends
and annoys those men sent from the Horde to him. The Khan has commanded to punish
him. What has been done with the gold and silver which Andrei has collected? Everything
written in his letters and all that he has quoted is false. Let him feel Mongol anger
because of his insolence. He might have lived in truth and honesty, then no evil would
be done in his country; his people would not suffer. But now let every harm come.
Let his people perish!”
</p>
<p>In such straits as this what could Nevski do? He could not defend his foolish brother.
Andrei himself knew well that Alexander could not act against the Mongols. On hearing
of Nevruya’s march, Alexander rushed to Sartak, at the Horde. Whether he went of his
own will or at the call of the Khan is uncertain. Hitherto he had avoided visits,
no matter what honor might come from them, but this time his decision was quick and
effective. The Khan, in his anger, had sent a detachment of Mongols to Vladimir. What
could he do to allay that anger? Of course he could tell the whole truth to the Khan
without concealment, but it would injure Andrei. He could excuse Andrei only by laying
the blame on his youth and his lack of good sense. This he did, and succeeded.
</p>
<p>Soon after his return an event occurred which sent him again to the Horde. Sviatoslav,
his uncle, fell ill, and died somewhat later. While alive this uncle was senior and
demanded the Vladimir principality. Alexander would not act against Sviatoslav. Michael
had seized the crown from his uncle; Andrei held it not through his right or by force,
he held it through the Khan’s pleasure. But a clear road to the throne was now open
to Nevski. A younger brother should not be preferred to an elder. By his foolish conduct
Andrei had incurred the Khan’s anger, and with it great suffering for the country.
Alexander could remain silent no longer. He begged the Khan to recognize him as Grand
Prince and guaranteed peace in Vladimir.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb278">[<a href="#pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>They saw at the Horde that his right was undoubted. Still they wished at the same
time to punish and give a sharp lesson to all who might need it. The command had been
given; the Mongols had already set out on their “promenade.” Alexander remained with
Sartak, who was then ruling. He preferred to intercede from time to time in so far
as was possible, and not to witness the bloodshed and suffering in his birthplace.
</p>
<p>Nevruya sent his commanders, Kotya and Olabuh, with a legion of warriors to plunder
Suzdal. Andrei complained of the indifference of other princes, some of whom he said
served the Mongols against their own brothers, and others were like Sviatoslav, his
uncle, who on a time summoned eaters of raw flesh to help him against his own people.
“O Lord!” exclaimed he, “how long must we fight with each other and bring in Mongols?”
</p>
<p>Nevruya reached the walls of Vladimir, but Andrei and Yaroslav had left the city before
his arrival. The Mongols overtook them in Pereyaslavl, where Andrei gave battle, preferring
to fight in Alexander’s territory rather than in his own. The battle was stubborn,
but it was won by the Mongols. Andrei fled to Novgorod, and thence to Pskoff, but
through fear of the Mongols neither city would admit him. Then he went farther, either
beyond the Baltic or to Riga, taking with him his princess, the daughter of Daniel
of Galitch.
</p>
<p>Yaroslav, after this vain attempt to assist Andrei, saved himself by fleeing first
to Ladoga and thence to Pskoff, but his wife was killed and his children were taken
into captivity. The Mongols inflicted great suffering and slaughtered a multitude
of people. Those who were able to escape fled, and, scattering through forests, lived
among wild beasts, as men had lived during Batu’s invasion. Nevruya withdrew after
that, and Alexander returned from the Horde to Vladimir, where his first work was
to collect the people, and resettle ruined places.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">ALEXANDER NEVSKI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1252–1253 Alexander Nevski began rule and was the real successor of Yaroslav, his
father. When Andrei had grown weary of exile, he begged Nevski to intercede for him
at the Horde. Meanwhile Sartak, Batu’s son, had been murdered, as is said, by Berkai,
his uncle, who took the Kipchak throne and waited confirmation from Mangu, at that
time Grand Khan.
</p>
<p>Again all Russian princes had to visit the Horde and wait to have their titles confirmed.
Alexander sent his nephews, Glaib and Boris, with rich gifts to Ulavchi, the favorite.
The gifts were accepted and Andrei was forgiven, but Nevski himself had to go to the
Horde with his guilty brother to receive the formal pardon.
</p>
<p>The eternal enmity in Novgorod between the strong and the weak; the rich and the poor;
the rooted hostility of haughty merchants and opulent traders to craftsmen and land-tillers;
and the rivalry among the ambitious for power and offices raged unceasingly. From
of old a large number, and at times a majority, were attracted to the Russia outside
of Great Novgorod. There had long been partisans of Vladimir among Novgorod boyars,
men who thought it well for their country to act with Vladimir and even to be merged
in it, but there were also implacable opponents to either coöperation or union, and
these nourished hatred for Vladimir at every hazard. On the Vladimir side were all
the more or less well-to-do people, the peace men. Therefore it seemed as if the adherents
of Vladimir were only the well-to-do, and the satisfied, who cared not for the poor;
but this was not the case. On the side of Vladimir were the land-tillers and common
folk.
</p>
<p>When Nevski took power in Vladimir he placed his eldest son, Vassili, in Novgorod.
Vassili could not oppress Novgorod; he was too young for such action. He was, also,
a real Novgorod partisan, <span class="pageNum" id="pb280">[<a href="#pb280">280</a>]</span>as he showed later on by contemning his father. These partisans were supported by
the mob of the city, men without houses, with nothing to lose at any time, and nothing
to gain except what they could win through disorder. They were advocates of the loudly
lauded “Novgorod liberties.” They appeared, though untruly, as friends and defenders
of working men. But working men saw in boyars who “loved liberty” their chief and
main enemies. They saw in them persons who sought liberty for themselves, but not
for “small people.” Among these boyars were the very rich, the proud, who recognized
no man beyond their circle. In all riots, no matter how many there might be, these
great and rich persons directed the councils and managed the city. Some of them claimed
to love liberty and poor men; others did not go that far. But in cases of riot both
divisions of those “great people” strove to hold the street mob at command. They put
forward bold rioters, who cared not for small or great persons, but found profit in
disorder. And when during encounters the people came to examine the question at issue,
or had at last to interfere in those matters, such confused causes were presented
that it seemed beyond human power to explain them. Each side appealed to the rights
of Great Novgorod and the good of the people, but the people could never find out
the real cause of the disturbance, or where there could be any profit for them in
the turmoil.
</p>
<p>Just such a riddle was offered in the case of Vassili, son of Nevski. There was a
party in Novgorod which had pretexts at all times for rousing the people, and beclouding
good counsel. As Mongol oppression increased and taxes and tribute grew heavier, oppression
of all kinds gave designing men chances for evil incitement. They needed simply to
shout: “We are defending our liberties against cursed eaters of raw flesh. Away then
with favorites of the Khan, slaves to Mongols!” and the conflict would begin.
</p>
<p>In 1255 Novgorod disturbers summoned Yaroslav as prince to their city. Nevski was
astounded when he heard that his son had been driven away in disgrace, and that his
place had been given to Yaroslav. Why could Yaroslav serve Novgorod better than Vassili,
unless because Yaroslav was in disgrace at the Horde, and under the Khan’s anger?
Nevski moved at once against Novgorod. In Torjok, where he met his son, he learned
still newer details of the riot from Novgorod men, who had come out to <span class="pageNum" id="pb281">[<a href="#pb281">281</a>]</span>meet him. The city was terribly excited, disorder had taken unusual proportions. Yaroslav
had fled when he heard that his brother was coming. The posadnik at that time was
Anani, a well-known opponent of Vladimir. The adherents of Vladimir, who were, of
course, favorable to Nevski, strove to allay the excitement, and bring back Vassili,
but they also had an object apart from this: their leader was Mihalko Stepanovitch,
whom they wished to make posadnik; therefore they accused Anani of causing the disturbance,
and tried to expel him from office. Mihalko appeared boldly against his opponents,
and the people were divided. It seemed to uninformed observers as if Mihalko’s adherents
were seeking merely for the profit of boyars. “Were they not mainly those rich men,
who cared not for poor folk, while Anani’s adherents were simple men, standing up
bravely for liberty and the honor of Novgorod?” The excitement became greater and
greater. Nevski, having drawn near, sent a command to Novgorod to put an end to the
riot, and give him Anani. Through this the excitement was not decreased, but heightened
immensely,—nay, it became general. The outbreak was involved by the fact that Anani,
though a known enemy of Vladimir, proved to be innocent this time. The disturbers
on both sides had abused his name greatly. One party promised to die for him, the
other to throw him into the river, and drown him. Some declared that the whole riot
was made to protect their good guardian and defender, while others represented him
falsely as the banisher of Vassili, and the father of every known evil. Those in arms
against Mihalko encamped at Nikola, and swore to die for Anani.
</p>
<p>When Nevski was approaching, they asked of one another, “What shall we do?” and finally
resolved not to surrender any of their people. The “small folk” kissed the cross,
declaring: “We will defend Novgorod rights and live or die for them.” When Nevski
commanded them to surrender Anani, all were confused, and, not knowing what course
to pursue, they went to Dolinot, the archbishop, and counseled. They knew Nevski’s
persistence, they knew that when he had once taken a position he would not retire
from it, and to the demand these words were added: “If ye will not yield me Anani,
I am no longer your prince, I will march straight against you.” They decided at last
to beg Dolinot, <span class="pageNum" id="pb282">[<a href="#pb282">282</a>]</span>and Klim, the commander, to go to Nevski in the name of all Novgorod, and say to him:
“Come, Prince, to thy throne and give no ear to offenders. Work thy displeasure on
Anani and others.”
</p>
<p>The two men went to Nevski as ambassadors. All waited their return with impatience.
The prince listened neither to Klim nor to Dolinot. When they returned and announced
their failure, there was sorrow on both sides. In the meeting which followed, people
said with one voice: “It is a sin for those men who have brought us to quarrel with
Nevski.” They came almost to bloodshed, and if blood did not flow the whole merit
belonged to Anani. Mihalko with his men was ready to fall on Anani’s adherents, but
Anani sent secret observers to note all that was happening. When the adherents of
these two men came to blows, and the mob rushed to burn the house of Mihalko and kill
him, Anani stopped them, saying: “Brothers, if ye wish to kill him, ye must take my
life from me first.”
</p>
<p>The third day after this, Nevski’s forces stood fully armed before Novgorod. On the
fourth day he sent again a message to the city, but now it was changed somewhat: “Remove
Anani from office, and I will forgive you.” All yielded willingly, and Anani himself
before others. They gave the office to Mihalko, making peace with Nevski on his own
terms. Prince Vassili was seated in Novgorod again, and his return should have pleased
the city, since his reign was not without profit. The Riga Germans, and also the Swedes,
had begun new attacks on the Novgorod borders, and frequent raids were made by the
Lithuanians. Vassili won victories over all these enemies. The Lithuanians were crushed;
the prince pursued them far west of Toropets. The Germans withdrew before the Pskoff
warriors, and the Swedes were badly defeated.
</p>
<p>This new attack of the Swedes disturbed Nevski, hence he came to Novgorod with large
forces, and commanded the city to assemble fresh regiments. The point of his intended
attack was kept secret. Cyril, Metropolitan of Russia, came with him, and conducted
the prince and his troops to Koporye. From there he sent him on his journey, after
blessing the warriors, who learned then that their campaign was to end in that region
where in summer the sun does not set for six months, and in winter does not rise for
the same <span class="pageNum" id="pb283">[<a href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>length of time. This locality—the country of the Lopars, later called Lapland by Germans—was
the remotest part of Novgorod possessions, and was visited rarely, for it had not
been assailed hitherto by the enemies of Russia, but about this time the Swedes were
endeavoring to take those lands from Russia, and connect them with Sweden.
</p>
<p>This was among Nevski’s most striking campaigns. Marching along difficult cliffs and
through dense forests he finally reached the sea. The wearied Novgorod men now refused
to go farther, though they had made but half the journey, so Nevski sent them home
and finished the campaign with his own personal followers, who were as untiring and
fearless as their prince. He won all the seacoast, and returned bringing a multitude
of prisoners, and leaving the country behind him in fear and obedience. Nevski’s men
had before this pushed through the gloom of Yatoyag forests; they had made paths through
wooded swamps in Lithuania; they had suffered from blizzards in Trans-Volga regions;
they had endured all kinds of hardship and toil in campaigning, but they had seen
nothing like that which they experienced in this war against Chuds and Lopars (Fins
and Lapps). Nevski had now marked with his sword, for the use of coming ages, the
Finnish boundary of Russia.
</p>
<p>Whenever Nevski went to the Horde he was distinguished beyond other princes; they
did not detain him too long; they granted his requests, and dismissed him with honor.
When he brought with him Yaroslav, his brother, as he had brought Andrei earlier,
the Khan forgave Yaroslav, who after that remained quietly in his own possessions.
And when an order came from the Khan to send forces beyond the Terek near the foot
of the Caucasus, the Russians were freed from this service at Nevski’s request.
</p>
<p>The prince suffered more and more from those visits to the Horde. In former days he
seemed stern and serious after each of them, but now he seemed worn and exhausted.
His health did not promise long life to him. The demands of the Mongols were increasing,
and soon a decision was published which brought all men to despair when they heard
it. No one had power to set aside or change this decision. The Khan commanded to take
a great census, to count all his subjects, and increase his income by imposing <span class="pageNum" id="pb284">[<a href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>a head tax. This time Nevski’s intercession was useless. The greedy master of the
Horde insisted on his decision, adding that such was the will of the Grand Khan. Mangu
had in fact commanded to enumerate all men and things under Mongol dominion.
</p>
<p>Officials of the Horde appeared first in Ryazan and in Murom. There they counted the
people and described the land minutely. Dues were imposed upon all men except the
clergy. Town and village property, and occupations were described in this census.
The officials went thence to Suzdal, Rostoff, and Vladimir. One year and a second
had passed before they finished. They did this work with great care, without haste,
and most accurately. Next inspectors appeared to ensure the close gathering of the
tribute and taxes. All this time an ominous sound was heard coming from Novgorod,
though there had been order in the city since the second installation of Nevski’s
son, Vassili, now sixteen years of age and well conversant with the affairs of that
place.
</p>
<p>Nevski was observing the census carefully everywhere, in places ruled by others as
well as by himself. His labor in studying this work took much of his time and strength.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1257–1258 the Mongols were sent to Novgorod to enumerate the inhabitants
and property of that place. When the officials were leaving Vladimir, Nevski gave
them as assistants a number of his own men, but he did not go himself, since he wished
to hear from his son before further action. While he was waiting for news, the chief
Mongols came rushing back to Vladimir in anger. How they had been offended in Novgorod
no man could learn from their account and their outcries. With a great din they attacked
the prince, saying that they had gone to Novgorod believing in his word, but if they
were to be treated in this way they would throw aside everything and go back to the
Golden Horde straightway.
</p>
<p>Nevski, seeing clearly the danger, summoned his brothers, Boris from Rostoff, and
Andrei from Suzdal, but only with great difficulty could he detain the Mongols. At
last, however, they consented to return to Novgorod, if accompanied by Nevski and
his brothers. The Grand Prince, upon approaching Novgorod, was surprised that his
son did not come out to meet him. Most of the Mongols had followed their superiors
to Vladimir, only a few <span class="pageNum" id="pb285">[<a href="#pb285">285</a>]</span>had remained in the city; these declared that no census had been made, and added:
“We know not what is happening.”
</p>
<p>The posadnik, Mihalko, had been killed,—Anani had died a few months earlier. Some
said that Prince Vassili had declared to the people his willingness to die for the
liberties of Novgorod; others said that he was not in the city. A second posadnik
had been chosen, and killed. Klim, the commander, they had driven out of Novgorod.
</p>
<p>When Vassili heard that his father was coming, he had in fact said to the people:
“They are bringing fetters to put on us. Let us die for the liberties of Novgorod!”
He had been taught these daring words by boyars. But after uttering them his courage
failed and he fled to Pskoff with these same boyars.
</p>
<p>Nevski wished to march against Pskoff without waiting, but the Mongols would not permit
it; they feared to part with him. Novgorod then sent the following message to the
Mongols: “Honor from us to the Khan, and to you. We have gifts for him, and for you
also.”
</p>
<p>Nevski now turned to Pskoff with this message: “Send back my son and all the traitorous
boyars immediately.” The guilty men were sent back, and, knowing that Nevski was not
mild with offenders, they looked for dire punishment. “To evil men an evil end,” said
the people. “These boyars have brought Prince Vassili to sorrow.” All in the city
expected that one would be hanged, and another beheaded. The authors of these troubles
were, in fact, cruelly punished. Some had their eyes put out, some had a hand cut
off, others had their nostrils torn away, their tongues cut out, or their ears taken
off; Vassili was put under guard and sent to Suzdal.
</p>
<p>The Mongol officials, well pleased with this punishment, and with the rich gifts of
the city, promised to make no complaint to the Khan; they would either be silent,
they said, touching what had been done, or would mention it mildly. So those officials
were pacified, and brought to good humor.
</p>
<p>Novgorod had chosen Misha as posadnik, but he had been murdered during the disturbance.
They now selected Michael; a third man, Jiroha, was appointed as commander to succeed
Klim, who had been driven from Novgorod. The people begged <span class="pageNum" id="pb286">[<a href="#pb286">286</a>]</span>Nevski not to leave them without a prince. Many Novgorod men had recently visited
Vladimir; some of these had gone on errands, and some had been sent by Nevski to see
how obedience was rendered the Mongols in that city. Hearing from the people there
all the terrors of Nevruya’s “promenade” they knew well the meaning of a Mongol census
invasion. Some of these men, on returning, informed their friends that if Novgorod
would not yield to the census, a Mongol host would come quickly, and bring woe to
the city; others reported dread tidings: Mongol forces were marching already. Novgorod
grew quiet at once, and the leading citizens decided to permit the census to be taken.
Because of this decision, Nevski was able to satisfy the Mongols, and he begged them
not to delay or defer, but to carry out the Khan’s will immediately. They consented,
but required that the Grand Prince himself should stay with them.
</p>
<p>When the census officials appeared to begin their work again in Novgorod and districts
around it, the promise to yield was as if it had never been given. When the officials
stepped out of sleighs, and were assigned the best houses to live in, and the Mongols
made ready to pass from street to street, and from house to house, an ominous murmur
went up throughout Novgorod. In all districts near the city there was disturbance
and uproar. Men ridiculed the Mongols, and spoke evil words to their faces. The censors,
in alarm, asked Nevski to protect them. He sent guards to their houses, and among
these the son of the posadnik. But neither posadnik nor commander had meaning for
Novgorod malcontents. Not only were common people terribly excited, but the chief
men fell into two parties opposed to each other. The Khan’s officials threatened to
abandon their task altogether. Nevski was forced to stay with them always. The people
grew still more excited: “We will die for Holy Sophia!” was their watchword. The Mongol
officials turned to the boyars, repeating suggestively: “Permit us to take the census,
or we will leave Novgorod!” The boyars laid all blame on the people. The Mongols turned
then to Nevski, with these words: “Why should we stay here longer? Your people will
kill us.” On the square louder and louder were heard threatening voices. “Let us resist
to the death! Whoso is just let him join us!” The crowd of people felt sure of their
rights and complained: “The rich command <span class="pageNum" id="pb287">[<a href="#pb287">287</a>]</span>to count our heads. They make everything easy for themselves, but evil for small folk.”
There was a roar throughout the city: “We will die for justice!” All at once a report
was spread that the Mongols were to move on the Kremlin from two points. There was
a rush to the cathedral from all parts, and a cry rose: “Let us go to Saint Sophia.
We will lay down our heads there!”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Mongols were only thinking of how to save themselves. Nevski, greatly
fearing lest the people might kill them, did not think it wise to detain them longer.
Not merely had they not finished the census, they had barely begun it. Still, in spite
of the turmoil, no riot took place in that boisterous Novgorod, accustomed to disorder
and bloodshed. No “pagan eater of raw flesh” was attacked, either inside its walls
or beyond them.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1259, new envoys from the Horde arrived at Vladimir, men so important
that even the people remembered their names, which were Berkai and Kasatchik. They
were sent to command the Khan’s men, and to finish the census in Novgorod. Again Nevski
was forced to accompany census officials. On the way to Novgorod he joined with his
own forces Rostoff regiments, and also the regiments of Suzdal. Berkai and Kasatchik
had demanded this aid to protect them. They approached the city with a great force
of warriors. This time the Novgorod men were alarmed, but they yielded only when they
found resistance to be vain. The new envoys did not return to the Horde till the work
had begun in their presence and they felt sure that their subordinates would be able
to complete it. These men went along each street from house to house, describing accurately
all the land, houses, goods, and people.
</p>
<p>But Novgorod showed a no less desperate opposition than earlier, an opposition which
was strong, protracted and stubborn. Both sides were prepared for a bloody conclusion.
On one side was the dense population of a city in which all carried weapons; on the
other the armies of the Grand Prince and the Khan’s commanders. Two almost equal forces
stood opposed to each other, and had reached the utmost bounds of excitement. They
had come to that moment beyond which a bloody encounter must take place. But at this
critical juncture an idea flashed on Nevski which averted the peril. He begged the
Khan’s envoys <span class="pageNum" id="pb288">[<a href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>to go from Novgorod, and he would assume all responsibility. They did this, and then
he declared to the people that he had exhausted all means and methods of saving them.
He would leave them now to the Khan, they might meet his anger in their own way. Thereupon
he commanded his troops to leave the city immediately, and he himself walked forth
from the fortress. The Novgorod men had waited for his order to the troops to attack
them, and now to their amazement he had commanded those troops to march out of the
city. This command produced terror. All bowed down at once before Nevski, and implored
him not to leave them. They promised to yield to his will absolutely. This ended the
trouble. The Mongols were recalled, and their work began in good earnest. Later on
the delight of Great Novgorod was unbounded when the Khan’s agents finished the census,
and vanished.
</p>
<p>The struggle and anxieties of this period, ending with the completion of the Novgorod
census, took much time and strength from Nevski. Only in 1260 was there, as the chronicler
tells us, “any peace for Christians.”
</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1261, Nevski’s youngest son, Daniel, was born to him. After that
year the prince had no respite from suffering.
</p>
<p>The worst of the Mongol yoke was not that every man’s head, and every horn and hoof
of his cattle was registered, not that Mongol inspectors were stationed in all parts
of the country; the heaviest weight of the yoke came when the Khan farmed Russian
taxes to men from Khiva, Turkestan and Bukhara. Among partners and aids of those tax-farmers
were Jews and Armenians, persons of various languages and religions. These traders
in tribute, a people unheard of in Russia till that time, began a work which greatly
intensified Mongol oppression. They became real torturers, squeezing the last copper
coin from the people. They imposed grinding interest for arrears of tribute. They
were worse than the most cruel usurer. Men who were unable to pay they sold into slavery
or beat savagely with whips and clubs. This terror extended from end to end of the
country. From those galling oppressions came riots. The riots were suppressed most
unsparingly, and with bloodshed. No longer could safety and peace be connected with
any place. There were disorders in Suzdal, in Pskoff, even in Pereyaslavl Beyond the
Forest.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb289">[<a href="#pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>These uprisings were not against Mongols directly. The people beat tax-farmers and
their assistants, not the Khan’s men, hence the Khan could not be angry in the same
degree; still his anger might be looked for, and reports were often current that regiments
from the Horde were marching “to pacify” Russia.
</p>
<p>At this juncture news came that Germans, the Knights of Livonia, were advancing with
a numerous force to attack Pskoff. Nevski sent his own personal troops to Dmitri,
his son, Prince of Novgorod at that time, and ordered his brother, Yaroslav of Tver,
to go also; he went then to the Horde to try to save the Russian people from some
of their new and great afflictions. The gifts which he took with him were more valuable
than any he had given earlier, and his petitions were the simplest, and the most reasonable.
But at the Horde they gave Nevski to understand that they were dissatisfied. They
let him know that they were not pleased with him personally. Berkai was different
from what he had been while Batu was still living or while he was struggling with
Sartak for mastery. He was curbed now by no man; besides, he was angered by military
failure beyond the Caucasus, where he was warring with Hulagu, his strong cousin.
He detained Nevski without need all that winter, then he detained him during the following
summer, and only late in autumn could the prince set out for home, sick and broken,
to die before reaching Vladimir. He came to Nizni-Novgorod, and when they brought
him to Gorodets his last hour was near. At that place he took the monk’s habit, and
on November 14, 1263, his life left him.
</p>
<p>The death of Nevski fell on Russia like a thunderbolt. It was a national calamity
expected by no man, for with all his great services Nevski died when only forty-two
years had passed over him. Even when burying him people could not believe that he
had left them forever. His name, his very coffin seemed sacred.
</p>
<p>When the great Peter had founded St. Petersburg on the Neva, concluded peace with
the Swedes and restored the ancient patrimony of Ijora, he brought Nevski’s bones
to the capital, where they repose in the monastery of Alexander Nevski, and are honored
at present and will be for the ages to come as relics of a saint and a hero. There
is no better saint in the whole Russian calendar, and no greater statesman or warrior
in its history than Alexander Nevski. By his wisdom and by his policy of yielding
with apparent <span class="pageNum" id="pb290">[<a href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>resignation to the tyranny of the Mongols, he suppressed revolts which would have
perhaps brought about the abolition of native government, with the substitution of
Mongol for Russian princes. Such substitution would have endangered the language,
religion and race of the Russian people. This had to be avoided at every sacrifice.
No man knew the relative strength of the Mongols and Russians better than Alexander
Nevski; no man was more devoted to Russia than he; no man was more respected by his
own; therefore his words had weight, and when he explained that resistance would be
ruin and submission was the only road to salvation the people believed and obeyed
him. In this way he rescued Novgorod and many another city from utter destruction,
and saved the lives of untold thousands. Above all his influence remained; it curbed
passion and instilled patience and courage into the minds of men, and the knowledge
that violence only made the yoke more oppressive.
</p>
<p>About the time of Nevski’s death, Moscow began to increase in size and importance.
Daniel, his youngest son, received this town, then very small, and a few villages
around it, as his inheritance.
</p>
<p>In Yuri Dolgoruki’s principality of Vladimir was laid the foundation of Moscow, and
all that distinguished Vladimir from Rostoff and Suzdal distinguished Moscow in a
higher degree. The advantage of Vladimir over earlier cities consisted in this, that
there were none of those “ancient strong families” which held themselves separate
from others. The Vladimir principality was settled by people who had come from many
places and established themselves there during that historical period when out of
a varied multitude of Slav stocks and families were formed one Russian people. This
from the very first was the place of all Russia, this was Vladimir’s distinction.
This must be said in a higher degree touching Moscow, the youngest and most recent
of places subjected to Yuri, and formed later than others into a well-ordered region.
When Dolgoruki’s inheritance had become a strong state under princes succeeding him,
the cities therein became so assimilated to Vladimir that they recognized no longer
the pretensions to primacy of Rostoff and Suzdal. In the days of Big Nest the appellation
Great Russia was connected somewhat loosely with Vladimir. This appellation, before
which not only <span class="pageNum" id="pb291">[<a href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>Rostoff and Suzdal yielded, but Lord Novgorod, was forced to incline, became permanently
connected with Moscow, when that city rose to power finally. If, after the death of
Andrei Bogolyubski, Rostoff and Suzdal boyars insisted on calling Vladimir an adjunct,
they could not pretend that Moscow depended on the boyars of any place, since Yuri
Dolgoruki had raised it against boyars in general. The tradition was that Moscow had
been founded by Dolgoruki, and then seized from him by boyars with violence which
he punished with immediate death.
</p>
<p>The distinction of Vladimir rule lay in the fact that the power of the prince acted
firmly. Dolgoruki, and still more his son Andrei Bogolyubski, put an end to boyar
control, which in other principalities was strong, and in some of them absolute, almighty.
The struggle of boyars to uphold the ancient, and for them useful order of rule, their
struggle for exceptional rights above other men, had in the Vladimir land dropped
to the place and the character of intrigue and of treason, against which the people
rose almost unanimously. The power of the prince thus appeared with single effect,
and the people hastened to make it a state power. By precisely this aid of the people
Big Nest had overcome the proud and powerful “great ones,” who stood against the “small
people.” He had ended every claim of the boyars, claims hostile to all rule which
favored the people. He had earned the love of earth-tillers and other workers by the
fact that he permitted no town or district to be governed through boyar authority,
but sent his own faithful servants to manage, and went himself yearly with his family
and trusted persons to see what was taking place, and to personally give justice to
all men. These servants differed greatly from boyars; they were just as much subject
to the Vladimir prince as were the rest of the people. It was for their profit to
strengthen and support the native prince who was ruling.
</p>
<p>In the Vladimir principality the whole social structure was built upon land. The interests
of all coincided. All, from small to great, earth-tillers, artisans, clergy, merchants,
warriors up to the prince himself, formed one solid power, and this was Great Russia.
When Big Nest, near the end of his life, was opposed by his eldest son, Constantine,
and resolved on a radical change, he turned for support to the people. He desired
strength from the whole land as a unit. He did not assemble simply boyars in <span class="pageNum" id="pb292">[<a href="#pb292">292</a>]</span>an affair of such magnitude, he did not turn to his confidants only, he called boyars,
merchants, and all classes of people. Such a union of the prince and the people ruled
by him was confirmed by kissing the cross, and was a pledge of future union and consequent
greatness. This union was the special distinction, and formed the main force of Great
Russia. This belonged not to Rostoff and Suzdal, where, through ties with Great Novgorod
and the old time, the boyar spirit was still strong. Not to the earliest cities did
the trait belong at its best, but to later places, and most of all to the youngest,
for this trait depended much on the general success attained not immediately, but
slowly, with pain and great labor, by the princes of Vladimir, and later on by the
princes of Moscow.
</p>
<p>At first while they were bringing into Vladimir the new type of rule to replace the
old boyar order, the men pushed aside and driven out opposed it in every way possible.
They complained of the prince’s agents and servants, they invented keen sayings against
this new system. At that time none of the powerful men of the ancient order were reconciled
with the new, and some fled from the country. But in the days of Daniel, son of Nevski,
when Moscow was becoming prominent, the complete solidarity of prince and people,
and the devotion of the people to an established princely line, became the chief trait
of Moscow, the coming capital of Russia. The sturdy, industrious, persistent and peace-loving
people were delighted to have the youngest son of Nevski, who was but two years of
age when his father died, as Prince of Moscow and the country surrounding it. That
region invited new settlers, who came in large numbers from all sides, because there
was peace there and order, while north and south was disturbance and turmoil. This
great advantage of being a peaceful and modest place was at that time the preëminence
of Moscow, where Daniel, who alone of all the brothers had inherited the “sacred virtues”
of his father, ruled quietly and unobserved.
</p>
<p>Following Nevski’s death in 1263, there was a dreary interval during which the princes
struggled for the possession of Vladimir. Nevski was succeeded by Andrei, his brother,
who lived only a few months. Yaroslav of Tver, brother of Andrei, then became Grand
Prince. In the early years of his reign the people of Novgorod were involved in a
stubborn war with Danes and the Knights of Livonia. During these troubles they lived
in peace with <span class="pageNum" id="pb293">[<a href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>Yaroslav, but in 1270 they rose against him, and he was forced to ask aid of the Mongols.
They promised assistance, and had sent forward a considerable army when, through the
influence of Vassili, Yaroslav’s brother, it was suddenly recalled. The Grand Prince
and his warriors then marched alone against Novgorod, but at the instance of the Metropolitan
of Kief, he made peace with the rebellious boyars.
</p>
<p>In 1272 Yaroslav died, and was succeeded by Vassili, who lived somewhat less than
three years. Then Dmitri, son of Nevski, became Grand Prince. While the principality
was thus passing from the possession of one prince to that of another, the Mongols
were taking full advantage of the quarreling, confusion and disorder brought about
by constant change. They pillaged the provinces near by, and in 1278 burned Ryazan.
</p>
<p>In 1281 Dmitri’s brother, Andrei, conspired against him, and going to the Horde obtained,
through bribes and flattery, the title of Grand Prince. Troops were sent from Sarai,
and dependent princes were ordered to join their forces to Andrei’s and march against
Dmitri, but they refused. Because of this refusal, Andrei’s own warriors lost courage
and deserted him, and he fled. The Mongols, meanwhile, ravaged Murom and many large
towns. Pereyaslavl resisted and received dire punishment. It was sacked and most of
the people were slaughtered.
</p>
<p>Andrei now went to Sarai a second time and brought an army against Dmitri, who fled
to Pskoff, and the Mongols seated Andrei on the throne of Vladimir. Again Russian
towns were pillaged. Suzdal and Moscow suffered greatly, churches were sacked and
precious vessels broken. If people resisted they were slaughtered. Dmitri, driven
from Vladimir, wished to return to Pereyaslavl, his capital, but he was attacked by
Andrei and fled to Tver, where Michael made peace between the brothers, and Dmitri,
after struggling for three years to hold his own, promised to abdicate all claim to
the Grand Principality. Shortly after this he fell ill and died (1294).
</p>
<p>During all these troubled years Moscow had been slowly gaining power and influence.
Daniel, called by the people, who loved his peaceful and gentle life, “Holy Daniel,”
was the first Prince of Moscow, the first real heir to it, and he became the founder
of the Moscow line of princes, as well as the founder of the city’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb294">[<a href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>greatness. Nevski’s youngest son received the smallest portion, but, though no one
could even dream of it in Daniel’s day, it was to excel in glory and importance every
other capital in Russia. Vladimir, Kief and Novgorod all paled before Moscow. After
Daniel had united to his capital places on the border and had acquired Pereyaslavl,
his portion, by its size and good order, surpassed every other. He was not Grand Prince;
the glory of his name, which was to be handed down from generation to generation,
was not in a resounding title, or in mighty deeds. His entire reign passed in comparative
peace, but to him specially fell the honor of maintaining the illustrious memory of
his ancestors, so that they might be renowned among Russians till the remotest generation.
The glory of his name is connected forever with Moscow. While his brothers were struggling
with one another and with their uncle for the Grand Principality of Vladimir and the
title, not one of them left a permanent inheritance to their children, not one of
them became famous. Daniel, called simply “the Moscow prince,” collected an entire
principality around his inconsiderable town, and amassed such an inheritance for his
descendants that not only his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren, but his own
children were called Princes of All Russia.
</p>
<p>We have few facts concerning Daniel; they are not to be found in Russian chronicles.
He was among the best of the princes—a man who worked in the gloomy days of Mongol
oppression.
</p>
<p>Daniel’s work was continued by his son Ivan, surnamed Kalitá (Purse). As his father
had gathered around Moscow a whole principality and his residence had become the capital
of a coming empire, so Ivan began to gather round Moscow all the unconnected parts
of the country, and in his day the city appeared as the center of Great Russia, its
genuine capital, and Vladimir ceased to be important. Though without the splendid
virtues of his father, he, more than any of his brothers, resembled him. A churchgoer,
he loved home and economy,—the latter he carried to excess even. His predecessors
had struggled for the Grand Principality, but Ivan left this work to Yuri, his brother,
and improved that which his father had left him. To things beyond Moscow, Ivan paid
no attention. During twenty-five years his name was mentioned rarely. Meanwhile he
was toiling at the heritage left by Nevski and winning strength in it. One of his
great works consisted <span class="pageNum" id="pb295">[<a href="#pb295">295</a>]</span>of clearing the whole principality of thieves, evil-doers and robbers. There was no
such order anywhere in that day as in Moscow, and the city increased through immigration
and otherwise beyond all places.
</p>
<p>Besides other advantages, the central position of this principality helped it immensely.
In it the roads crossed in every direction. The great water system began in its borders.
Craftsmen, traders and people of all kinds came readily to settle in Moscow. Land-tillers
found it more to their profit to live there than in places torn by quarrels. Hence
Moscow was made up of men from every part of Russia. Next to Moscow was Tver, but
there was less strength in Tver and less order. The turmoils of Novgorod were felt
in Tver somewhat, and Tver was more exposed to raids from Lithuania. The place was,
moreover, distinguished for an almost frivolous and insolent demeanor toward Mongols;
hence in Moscow there was less danger from Mongols. All these causes taken together
made Tver less desirable to immigrants than Moscow.
</p>
<p>In 1304 died Andrei, brother of Nevski. After his death, two men were rivals for the
dignity of Grand Prince. Yuri, son of Daniel, through the glory of his grandfather,
Nevski, and the newly won greatness of Moscow, where he and his brother Ivan were
ruling, looked on himself as the senior. But the senior in fact, if descent were decisive,
was Michael of Tver, the youngest brother of Nevski. Both Yuri and Michael hastened
to occupy the throne of Vladimir, and each strove to incline Novgorod to his side.
Michael hurried off to the Horde to win the patent, but found that Yuri had preceded
him. The boyars of Andrei, the recent Grand Prince, were in favor of Michael, and
the men who had served with Andrei were convinced that the throne would fall to their
candidate. But Yuri succeeded in occupying Vladimir, and Novgorod was divided. Though
that city contained many followers of Yuri, it did not reject Michael. The Novgorod
men declared to both candidates that they would accept him who obtained the Khan’s
patent; still they murmured at Michael. Why was he sending officials to Novgorod while
he lacked confirmation?
</p>
<p>Maxim, the metropolitan, was friendly to Michael; he revered Ksenia, Michael’s widowed
mother, as one of God’s chosen people; and respected Michael’s wife, Princess Anna,
because she had <span class="pageNum" id="pb296">[<a href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>many Christian virtues. Yuri seemed to him not in the right as compared with his senior.
Seeing the general movement of warriors and regiments on both sides, he was greatly
alarmed, and, wishing for agreement, he not only threatened Yuri, but implored him
to make peace. Maxim thought that he had succeeded, but he did not know Yuri, who
never dropped any claim that he cherished. He would give no word not to go to the
Horde. When the metropolitan tried to win a promise he answered:
</p>
<p>“I am not going to the Horde for a patent, but for another object.”
</p>
<p>This wily prince, who was ambitious and unprincipled, stopped at nothing to obtain
power, which was dearer to him than all things else. He knew well that the Horde was
all-powerful, and the Khan was its master in Russia. The word of the Khan was his
sword; on this sword Yuri’s trust was unswerving, and he used every means to wield
it; hence he set out for Sarai. While on the journey Michael’s adherents came very
near seizing Yuri. He escaped, however, and by a roundabout road reached the Horde
in safety, but only after much effort.
</p>
<p>The Mongol magnates charmed the prince with their readiness to feast and make friends
with him. “Give more than Michael, and the yarlyk (patent) will be thine,” said they.
So the princes strove to surpass each other in making presents to the Khan’s wives
and favorites, as well as to Horde magnates. It proved, however, that Michael had
more gold to spend than had Yuri. Yuri halted, and going to Michael, he said: “Let
us strive no longer. I will not ruin my heritage. Let Vladimir be thine.” Soon after
this the Khan gave the patent to Michael, who returned home eight months later.
</p>
<p>While the princes were at the Horde there was great activity in Russia. Boris, Yuri’s
brother, sent by him to seize Kostroma, had been captured and taken to Tver. Novgorod
men had expelled Michael’s boyars, who strengthened Nova-Torg, and then planned to
attack Pereyaslavl and take it from Moscow. Akinfi, a Moscow boyar, having quarreled
with Rodion Nestorvitch, a boyar who had come from Kief to Moscow with seven hundred
followers and had received the first place in service, left Moscow in anger to seek
a better place, which he found with the Tver prince, who made him the first among
boyars. Akinfi assisted in <span class="pageNum" id="pb297">[<a href="#pb297">297</a>]</span>planning the campaign, and led the troops against Pereyaslavl. But in Tver there were
many well-wishers of Moscow, and they gave warning of Akinfi’s adventure. The army
which Ivan hurriedly led from Moscow was successful. Akinfi’s troops were defeated
and he lost his life in the struggle; with him fell his son-in-law and many warriors.
His sons, Ivan and Feodor, fled to Tver with few attendants. As Rodion Nestorvitch,
who had sustained a leading part in this unsparing and decisive conflict, was leaving
the battle-field, he raised his rival’s head on a lance-point and held it up before
Ivan of Moscow. Ivan’s name, mentioned this once, was not mentioned earlier in Russian
<span class="corr" id="xd32e2571" title="Source: chronicle">chronicles</span>, and was left unmentioned thereafter for a long time. In the quarrels with Tver and
Vladimir not Ivan, but Yuri, his brother, is prominent.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince Michael, on returning from the Horde, settled down in Tver and ruled
both the Grand Principality and Novgorod through his lieutenants. He would not leave
unavenged Akinfi, his chief boyar. A campaign against Moscow was undertaken with every
force which the Grand Prince could summon. But he had not the strength to bend Moscow.
Neither opponent had sufficient power to crush the other; one had to retreat and the
other had to let him go unpunished. It seemed that all that remained for Michael was
to rule and live peaceably as Grand Prince. He had no foe except Yuri, who, though
he had made peace with Michael, would not acknowledge his headship; nay, more, he
challenged Michael’s position directly. Causes and excuses for this were plentiful
on every side. Yuri not only did not yield the disputed Tver boundaries to Michael,
but he seized other lands in addition. At last Michael complained without ceasing
that Yuri was taking Tver lands from him, while he, Michael, sought nothing save lands
belonging to Tver in the time of his father. Yuri would not give peace to his rival
in Novgorod or Vladimir; he roused both secret and open intrigues against him unceasingly
through his adherents in the two cities, and tried to undermine Michael at all times.
Novgorod as usual was divided against itself. Factions were at war in the city. Some
were in favor of the prince, while others demanded his expulsion and wanted a new
man.
</p>
<p>Yuri and Ivan ruled together in Moscow and gave no voice to their brothers. It was
evident that Yuri intended to place his younger <span class="pageNum" id="pb298">[<a href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>brothers in other principalities. With that intent he had sent Boris to Kostroma,
where he was captured by Tver men. Besides Kostroma there was only Nizni-Novgorod,
but in general Yuri had his eye upon any place which might be open to seizure. He
was not troubled with delicacy in dealing with princes, and soon there was a quarrel
about Nizni-Novgorod. As Michael was patient, Yuri’s insolence was overlooked for
a season, but the more Michael yielded, the greater were Yuri’s demands on him. Their
strength might seem equal, but Moscow was so far superior that the Tver prince, even
adding Vladimir, was not the stronger<span class="corr" id="xd32e2580" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>In 1308, three years after his first attack upon Moscow, Michael, because of Novgorod,
was forced to take arms against Yuri a second time. This campaign was undertaken with
all the power which the Grand Prince could summon and there was a great battle; much
harm was inflicted, but again Michael failed to take Moscow, and returned to Tver
without triumph.
</p>
<p>Michael’s position in Novgorod was difficult. There were old involved boundary questions
between Novgorod and Vladimir; also between Tver and Novgorod. If Michael did justice
to Tver, he made Novgorod an enemy. If he acceded to Novgorod’s demands, he made Tver
indignant. Yuri, knowing this difficulty, inflamed Michael’s enemies in Novgorod,
and upheld the demands of that city.
</p>
<p>Tok Timur, Khan of the Golden Horde, died in 1312, and was succeeded by Uzbek, the
first Mongol ruler of Russia to become a Mohammedan, though he was more Mongol by
far than a follower of Mohammed. Again all princes must visit Sarai and bow down to
the Khan. Michael of Tver appeared at the Horde before the others. He was accompanied
by the Metropolitan of Russia, who was allowed to go home after a very short time.
He returned to Vladimir before any one looked for him, but for his friend Michael
they waited till they ceased to expect him. One year passed, a second began. At last,
however, his visit came to a favorable end. Uzbek confirmed him in the Grand Principality
and commanded Novgorod’s obedience. This was to be assured by Horde warriors, who
were prompt in assistance. With Michael went from the Horde three “sultans” (commanders),
Taitmar, Matroja and Indy. And the capricious Moscow prince, who, during Michael’s
absence, had made himself master of Novgorod, <span class="pageNum" id="pb299">[<a href="#pb299">299</a>]</span>was threatened with anger and summoned to Sarai to answer Michael’s charges. Yuri
set out from Novgorod directly, leaving Afanasi, his brother, and Feodor Rjerski behind
him to govern the city. A Novgorod embassy went to the Horde to help Yuri. This support
was especially valuable to him, since the people never sent men with empty hands to
do business; they scattered gold and silver as far as was needed. In money power no
place at that time was equal to Novgorod. Yuri knew well how to manage the Mongols.
The Golden Horde magnates had pleased him immensely in the days of his earliest visit,
because of their readiness to feast and rejoice with him. He had had friends and allies
during Tok Timur’s reign, but since he had promised Novgorod men to relieve them of
Michael, he had vastly more influence, for Novgorod’s liberality was measureless.
He received worthy aid for the road and was assured of further assistance whenever
the need came, and in any proportion necessary, if only the Novgorod wish could be
gratified. Yuri felt sure of success. When he entered Sarai all things seemed favorable.
To begin with, Prince Michael, his enemy, who in Tok Timur’s time had contended with
him for the Grand Principality, though the patent had been given him, was not popular
at the Horde, for he had not become intimate with any one. He knew not how to win
Mongol favor. Mild and sedate, he had not roused respect even by his obedience. His
sober, methodical life was unendurable to Mongols. On the other hand, Yuri was loved
by his old, and now by his new friends. Kavgady was the keenest of the Mongol magnates,
and he had the Khan’s fullest confidence; with this man Yuri became specially intimate.
Soon the Khan himself was very gracious to Yuri, who was at home not only throughout
the Horde, but in the Khan’s family. There was no great feast without him. In 1297,
when young, he had married a Rostoff princess, but he was now a widower. Soon it was
known to all the high Mongols that Konchaka, the Khan’s favorite sister, was to marry
Yuri. Uzbek permitted her to become a Christian, and she took in baptism the name
Agatha.
</p>
<p>Yuri remained at the Horde about two years. While he was there Afanasi, his brother,
and Feodor, placed by him in Novgorod, carried on war against Michael, who marched
toward Novgorod and met their forces at Torjok in the spring of 1316. The Novgorod
<span class="pageNum" id="pb300">[<a href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>warriors were choice and not few in number, but they were of the boyar party, for
the people would take no part in this war. Their army was defeated and was forced
to seek refuge inside the walls of Torjok.
</p>
<p>Then Michael sent to them saying: “Give me the princes, Afanasi and Feodor, and I
will make peace.” “We will die for Holy Sophia with honor,” was the answer. “We will
not yield up those princes.” Then Michael sent a second time: “Give me Feodor alone.”
At first they refused, then finally surrendered him, and peace was made.
</p>
<p>But soon a new war broke out which dragged on a whole year, if not longer. Michael
sent his posadnik and officials to Novgorod, but the city expelled them and the war
continued, while Yuri was absent arranging with Uzbek. Novgorod charged Michael with
perfidy. The tribute which Michael imposed on Torjok was not paid, and Novgorod accused
him of detaining hostages and of seizing their people, with arms and horses. They
sent an embassy to Yuri, but Tver warriors intercepted those envoys and detained them.
Novgorod complained that after Michael had withdrawn from Torjok they sent a request
through their bishop asking him to liberate the Novgorod people detained by him, but
this he had refused to do. The Tver men in answer pointed out Novgorod’s injustice.
“Why send envoys to Yuri and the Horde, and incite anger against Tver, Pskoff, Ladoga
and other places? Why did Novgorod in time of council throw Basok into the river,
declaring him a spy from Prince Michael? Why also was Daniel Pistsoff slain?”
</p>
<p>Again Michael marched against Novgorod, but this time, though he was not defeated,
he suffered greatly. Approaching within fifty versts of the city and discovering that
men from Pskoff, Ladoga and other places had come to help Novgorod, he withdrew. While
retreating his troops lost their way amid lakes and swamps, and were forced by hunger
to eat their own horses and even the rawhide of their shields. Many died of hunger
and cold; those who survived reached home in great wretchedness.
</p>
<p>But this unfortunate expedition did not affect Michael so much as the news from the
Horde, news which forced him to make peace with Novgorod, remit all arrears and return
prisoners and hostages. Novgorod, on its part, engaged to withdraw from Yuri and take
<span class="pageNum" id="pb301">[<a href="#pb301">301</a>]</span>no part in quarrels between the two princes. The news which reached Michael before
he made peace, and which Novgorod did not at that time know, was then published to
all men. The Khan’s brother-in-law, Yuri, with his princess, had left the Horde with
large regiments from the Khan, and a suite of Horde magnates. They were coming to
strip Michael of his office. No one doubted that Yuri was Grand Prince; that was the
report, and the first to believe it was Michael. He waited for further news, but no
news was forthcoming. No messenger came from the Khan, nor did he receive any word
from his men, who were at the Horde in attendance. But that which was done in the
Mongol camp and declared to the world was incredible, unless Yuri had the patent.
</p>
<p>Kavgady sent Telebuga, his assistant, to Novgorod to summon all warriors to the banners
of Yuri. Astrobyl was sent to the Volga for the same purpose. Kavgady himself moved
with his own troops, and some from Yuri. They expected reinforcements from places
above and below them.
</p>
<p>Michael, fearing an attack on Tver, increased its defenses and summoned in other princes.
But in Rostoff and Suzdal, as well as Vladimir, no one knew anything accurately. So
that while some princes favored Michael, others joined his opponents, and still others
were undecided which prince to support, though Kavgady had ordered all to join Yuri.
</p>
<p>Michael marched toward Kostroma, but when he came in sight of Yuri and his army, he
sent him this message: “If the Khan has given thee the office of Grand Prince, I withdraw.
But touch not my heritage.”
</p>
<p>One of the principal duties and the distinguishing right of the Grand Prince was to
give the Khan all the tribute collected by princes. For this the Grand Prince was
responsible directly, and in questions concerning it he treated smaller princes as
pleased him. They had to deal with him only, and had not the right to appear at the
Horde with their tribute. Hence, because of those tributes, there were endless disputes
between the Grand Prince and the princes beneath him. It was almost impossible to
disentangle the questions of tribute paid too late or too early, neglected, overpaid
or underpaid. But Michael was distinguished in this as in all things requiring accuracy.
Every item was recorded. How much he had received from this prince or that, was written
down <span class="pageNum" id="pb302">[<a href="#pb302">302</a>]</span>carefully and delivered with precision. So now, when he yielded the office of Grand
Prince, he thought it his duty to give a clear list of the tribute, including that
which was not yet delivered. All this was explained to Kavgady and to Yuri. Michael
then gave up the Grand Principality and the tribute.
</p>
<p>“I will remain in my own place,” said he; “only leave me in quiet.” Thus all was arranged
and Michael, before the eyes of his enemies, dismissed his main forces, leading home
only a small retinue. Meanwhile Yuri disbanded no warriors, but strengthened his army.
The Suzdal princes took Yuri’s side. Yuri now went to Moscow and with him went his
princess, “Konchaka,” as the people continued to call her. During the summer Michael
was occupied in fortifying Tver. Toward October, Kavgady and Yuri marched against
him. The whole Volga region joined Yuri. Novgorod men were to be at Torjok to act
against Michael.
</p>
<p>When Yuri’s army reached the Tver border he began to burn towns and take prisoners.
Avoiding the capital, he turned against the Tver possessions beyond the Volga. Michael
lost patience at this point. Tver men had always been noted for hating the Mongols.
Michael’s sons, his boyars and his warriors all demanded war, and he could not curb
them. “It is impossible,” said the people, “for thee not to go against Yuri. We are
ready to lay down our lives in this action.”
</p>
<p>Michael and his forces met the foe forty versts from the city, December 22, 1317,
and Yuri was thoroughly defeated. He fled to Novi-Torg with few attendants, and then
to Novgorod. His camp and his tent were seized by the victors. They captured Konchaka,
Yuri’s princess, and Boris, his brother. When Kavgady saw that the battle was lost,
he surrendered to Michael, whose armor was cut and hacked, but whose body was not
wounded.
</p>
<p>The delight of the victors was unbounded in view of the multitude of prisoners. But
the pleasure of their triumph was lessened by the fact that many Mongols had fallen
in the battle. Men learned now, and they might have guessed earlier, that the conflict
had been brought on by Yuri and Kavgady without the Khan’s order or knowledge. What
could they do in Tver with the prisoners? Michael lodged Konchaka in his palace with
honor, and gave her every attention. Kavgady and his attendants were favored with
gifts and with feasts. The Mongols flattered their entertainers <span class="pageNum" id="pb303">[<a href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>and praised their generosity, but this deceived no one. They remembered what wealth
they had lost in the battle, and how many captives had been taken from them, and it
was seen in their eyes how revenge lurked in their souls while they flattered.
</p>
<p>That winter, just before Lent, Yuri led Novgorod men against Michael, who, unwilling
to cause more bloodshed so soon after his recent victory, marched out, stopped Yuri
from crossing the Volga, and sent him this message: “We must go to the Khan; why should
we fight before going?” Yuri answered with insolence but agreed finally that both
should go to the Horde and let the Khan judge them. Michael declared that Konchaka
and Boris would be given up immediately, and the opponents parted without an encounter.
</p>
<p>But terrible trouble came now upon Michael. Konchaka died in his palace, and the report
was spread that she had been poisoned. The coffin containing the body of the ill-fated
woman was taken from Tver to Rostoff and given to Yuri’s relatives. Michael was weighed
down with woe. Fate seemed to pursue him in this struggle with Yuri.
</p>
<p>On learning that Michael was preparing to visit Sarai, Kavgady insisted that Yuri
should hasten and anticipate the Tver prince, and in clear proof of the importance
of doing so hurried off himself. When going, he advised Yuri to collect as many men
as possible of those who had had dealings with Michael in the matter of tribute, so
that they could be called to give testimony against the Tver prince.
</p>
<p>Michael understood well what serious work was before him, for it was known at the
Horde that Kavgady always misrepresented him to the Khan, and reports of this had
come to Michael. At last, toward the end of the summer, he realized that he must loiter
no longer. At Vladimir he met Akhmyl, an envoy, from whom he hoped to learn something
of what was taking place in Sarai. Akhmyl counseled haste; he gave no precise information,
only whispering Kavgady’s calumnies, “Be there before a month has passed,” said he.
“Kavgady has stated that thou art not coming.” Michael’s boyars advised him not to
go; his sons said, “Send us.” The prince hesitated. “One of thy sons is there now,”
said the boyars; “send another.” “Listen to us,” begged the sons. “Go not, thou art
<span class="corr" id="xd32e2619" title="Source: caluminated">calumniated</span>. Send us. Go when the Khan’s rage has softened.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb304">[<a href="#pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>Michael sat long in thought. At last he said, “The Khan has not asked for you. It
is my head that he wants. If I do not go, my inheritance will be seized, and many
Christians will perish. I must die sometime; better die now, and save others.” He
explained how he wished his inheritance to be divided; gave advice to his sons; wrote
his will and took farewell of them. During the whole journey to the Horde he was gloomy
and depressed. He was ready to pour out his soul before Uzbek, trusting in his justice.
He did not doubt that the Khan would be gracious if he only knew the facts in the
quarrel. But would the Khan know the facts?
</p>
<p>When Michael reached Sarai he found that Uzbek had gone, and he had to journey a thousand
versts farther, to find him near the mouth of the Don at the Sea of Azoff. Constantine,
Michael’s son, who had been in Sarai, could give his father no information except
that one of the Khan’s wives was kind; he had visited her and she liked him. From
his boyars, who were with Constantine at the Horde, he heard that the Khan had spoken
no evil against him. At the Horde all received his presents graciously, but he could
learn nothing decisive.
</p>
<p>At last the day came when he was to bow to the earth before Uzbek. He could see no
displeasure in the Khan’s visage; he seemed as friendly as when he had given the patent;
he was neither kind nor unkind. In the Horde it was the same—neither kind nor unkind.
There was no recognition between him and Kavgady or Yuri. The whole Horde was with
them, as it seemed to Michael. Everything confirmed the statement of his friends that
Kavgady was calumniating him always. It was said also that the intimates of the Khan
had mentioned repeatedly the necessity of judging the Tver prince. When the Khan promised
and afterward forgot, they reminded him that the case was important and should not
be deferred; that a state is made strong through showing favor to good men, and punishing
the wicked.
</p>
<p>Michael lived six weeks in anxiety without trial. Then he was suddenly summoned to
receive judgment. The Khan, who was as much occupied by amusement as by affairs, was
preparing for a grand hunt in the Caucasus and beyond those mountains. Pleasure, it
appeared, coincided with policy. Some said that he was taking the forces of the Horde
to a great hunt and was then going to a war on the Persian boundary. At all events,
before setting out, <span class="pageNum" id="pb305">[<a href="#pb305">305</a>]</span>he wished to settle certain questions which annoyed him, and suddenly he said to his
magnates, “Judge Yuri and the Grand Prince; then bring your decision. Whoever is right,
him will I reward; the guilty I will punish.” This was all Kavgady needed.
</p>
<p>Next day they summoned Michael. Many complaints were preferred against him: he had
withheld the Khan’s tribute; he had sent his wealth to Livonia; he had begged aid
of the Pope; he had borrowed money from tax collectors and princes, and had not returned
it; he had been a robber; he had been unjust to subject princes,—this must have referred
to Novgorod. Then came the two great offenses: he had poisoned Konchaka, and had warred
against the Khan’s envoys.
</p>
<p>The princes of the Horde sat in judgment; a great accumulation of complaints lay before
them. Kavgady and Yuri were among the judges; they were witnesses as well. When Michael
presented strict accounts of the tribute and lists of all taken from each person they
cried out: “Thou art haughty and disobedient; thou hast insulted the Khan’s envoy,
Kavgady, and fought with him; kept back the Khan’s tribute, and poisoned Yuri’s princess;
thou hast beaten the Khan’s magnates.” “I have obeyed the Khan,” answered Michael,
“and I obey him now. I have given accurate tribute. The Khan’s envoy attacked me with
warriors; I was forced to defend myself. After that I honored him and gave him good
presents; I took farewell of him with gifts, and with homage. I did not kill Yuri’s
princess; her death came from nature.”
</p>
<p>When the trial was ended it was repeated to the Khan. Uzbek was waiting. “Prince Michael,”
said the judges, “is worthy of death, but thy word is free. All will be done according
to thy pleasure.” And they explained the main offenses. The Khan commanded to give
a new trial and test the truth carefully a second time. The judges were confused and
retired with submission. But going later on to the Khan, by the advice of Kavgady,
who was assisting them, they said: “Michael is worthy of death. If thou command to
revise the late trial he should stand before us in fetters. We would not see thee
offended; thy glory and honor touch us, O Khan, and concern all the people.” Kavgady
now added: “The case between Yuri and Michael is known to me perfectly; I know the
whole truth of it.” “Do as ye like,” replied <span class="pageNum" id="pb306">[<a href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>Uzbek, after thinking a little. “But judge the case justly, and come to me afterward.”
</p>
<p>Michael was judged as he had been judged the first time, and warriors were commanded
to lead away the condemned man. The second trial was on Friday, and lasted till late
in the evening. The judges went directly to Uzbek. “We find Michael worthy of death
this time also,” said they. “If that is just,” replied Uzbek, “act as ye have decided.”
The judges now strove to hasten the execution, but Uzbek deferred it.
</p>
<p>From the moment of the second trial, Michael knew well that his cause was lost. On
returning to his tent he repeated the words “My days have vanished like smoke and
have passed like a vision.” Two hours later heavier fetters were put on him; his attendants
were expelled; his robes of a prince were stripped from his body, and the guards seized
his effects. This was done always in the case of condemned men. He was left then with
guards to watch over him strictly. On Sunday he learned that the Horde was to follow
the Khan to a hunt on the Caucasus north and south of the Terek. That day they put
a kang on him,—an instrument of torture and an index of infamy, borrowed by the Mongols
from China. It was made of two planks, and was four-cornered like a small oblong table.
In the center was a round hole cut to fit the neck and a smaller one on either side
into which the hands of the victim were inserted. The planks were pushed apart, the
neck and wrists fixed in their places, and then the planks were brought together and
fastened. Chains were attached to the kang, by which men led the prisoner. In this
way the unfortunate Michael was led behind the Khan’s forces and for twenty-five days
he traveled in that horrible torture.
</p>
<p>Hunting, the favorite amusement of the Mongol Khans, continued usually a month or
two, and showed strikingly their character. The whole Horde was in motion. Two or
three hundred thousand men often shared in this immense spectacle and enjoyment. Each
man rode his best horse and wore his finest clothes; countless wagons carried goods
from Greece, India and other distant regions. Delight and luxury were visible everywhere.
Lonely steppes were filled with people; certain places in them became populous cities
for a day or two, and all was noise, mirth and turmoil. Michael dragged on, walking
behind this great <span class="pageNum" id="pb307">[<a href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>army of pleasure seekers, for in his case Uzbek had not spoken the death words. A
great part of the way the ill-fated prisoner was urged forward on foot. Occasionally
the kang was removed, but at such times he was heavily chained. The hunt lasted long
and extended far beyond the Terek to the mountains and the Caspian.
</p>
<p>When the decision of the judges was at last confirmed by the Khan, the execution was
summary. November 22, 1318, Kavgady saw Uzbek in the morning, and received the order
to execute Michael. Toward midday, while the prince, who had grown mortally weary
of life, was repeating the fifty-fifth psalm: “My heart is sore pained within me,
and the terrors of death are fallen upon me,” an attendant rushed up, and cried: “Kavgady
and Yuri are coming with a number of people.” “I know why they are coming,” said Michael.
</p>
<p>The two men halted on the market-place, at a distance of a stone’s throw from the
prisoner’s tent, and Michael was summoned. The executioners seized him and threw him
to the earth, but he sprang up quickly. They threw him again, beat him with fists,
and then with their heels stamped his life out. When they had killed him, they put
the corpse out on the steppe, where they left it. Yuri went to look at the body. “Why
art thou looking?” asked Kavgady, reproachfully. “He was to thee as thy father. Have
him covered!” One of Yuri’s men removed his upper garment and covered the body. Soon
after this, Michael’s attendants came out, tied the corpse firmly to a plank, and
then, by Yuri’s order, bore it to Moscow.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">IVAN KALITÁ</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1319, Yuri returned from the Horde with the Khan’s patent making him Grand Prince.
According to old Russian rules, he was equal to the sons of Prince Michael. If they
were superior through inheritance from a father who had held the position of Grand
Prince, a position which Yuri’s father had never held, he surpassed them through his
grandfather Nevski, who was senior to their grandfather, Yaroslav. In descent, men
might hold them equal. But Yuri surpassed the Tver prince in wealth, and in the number
of his warriors, and with the patent of the Khan he became chief, and all yielded.
</p>
<p>Yuri hastened to Vladimir and took the throne, merely making a short halt at Moscow,
to leave there Michael’s son Constantine, with his father’s boyars and servants. Yuri
had taken Constantine from the Horde, partly as a relative, partly as a prisoner;
the boyars were really prisoners. No one in Tver knew exactly what had taken place;
all were in doubt and anxiety, and when Yuri’s return was reported, men were sent
to Vladimir to discover the truth. They brought tidings to Tver that Prince Michael
was dead and his body had been taken to Moscow and buried.
</p>
<p>As soon as Yuri appeared in Vladimir, Dmitri, Michael’s eldest son, took possession
of Tver in accordance with the will of his father. Then he sent his younger brother,
Alexander, to Yuri, to ask for the body of his father. Yuri refused at first to deliver
it, but he at last consented, and the body was taken back to Tver.
</p>
<p>Boris, Yuri’s brother, died in Moscow soon after this, as did also Afanasi, whom Yuri
had settled in Novgorod, so that of Daniel’s sons only Yuri and Ivan were living.
When Yuri returned from the Horde as Grand Prince, he gave his inherited lands, as
it seems, to Ivan. In 1320, Ivan went to do homage to Uzbek; till <span class="pageNum" id="pb309">[<a href="#pb309">309</a>]</span>that time he had never seen him. In that year Tver had three marriages of princes:
Alexander and Constantine found brides among Russians, but Dmitri took a daughter
of Gedimin, the Lithuanian Grand Prince. This connection with Gedimin brought Dmitri
into intimate relations with an enemy of Russia, and made it more difficult still
for Tver to be friendly with Vladimir. Dmitri did not wish to see Yuri, or approach
him, or even hear his name mentioned. Outspoken and direct, irrepressible and passionate
the name Terrible Eyes had been given Dmitri, and it described<span id="xd32e2659"></span> him clearly.
</p>
<p>Yuri’s first move as Grand Prince was a quarrel with Ryazan, undertaken to punish
one of its princes. That labor finished, he moved on Dmitri. The task was “to take
his honor,” as the phrase ran in those days.
</p>
<p>Expeditions were made then, as they had been made earlier, to impose peace “with dread
and trembling.” Minor princes performed certain acts at the coronation of a Grand
Prince. If not to show submission, at least to recognize that he was their superior.
The Grand Prince made a treaty with each minor prince, causing him at the same time
to kiss the cross to observe it. When the Khan gave a patent to an important prince,
minor princes led his horse in the ceremony of installation.
</p>
<p>Yuri, of course, was not seeking a service of this kind, but as Dmitri had not ranged
himself with princes who acknowledged his headship, Yuri now led his warriors to attack
Tver. When Dmitri heard of this campaign against him, he made no move, but begged
his friend Varsonofi, the bishop, to save him from every discussion with Yuri. He
agreed to all terms in advance, so as to avoid meeting him. The bishop persuaded the
Grand Prince to withdraw from the country, after receiving a solemn declaration from
Dmitri that he would not strive to be Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>The chief mark of subjection in a minor prince at that time was to pay the Khan’s
tribute, not at the Horde, but to the Grand Prince. Yuri insisted on this, and if
negotiations with the bishop were protracted, it was only because of discussions on
that subject; but Dmitri in the end agreed to that also, and promised to send to Yuri
two thousand grievens, which he had collected from Tver as a tribute. Dmitri sent
this money to Yuri that year (1321). The following year he went to the Horde for confirmation
as senior <span class="pageNum" id="pb310">[<a href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>heir to the Tver principality. He took gifts to the Khan and rendered homage as usual;
then, unable to restrain himself, he told the Khan all that was troubling his spirit.
Disregarding the ceremony which was binding on every one, he explained to Uzbek how
Kavgady and Yuri had calumniated his father, condemned him, and killed him in his
innocence. The Terrible-Eyed Dmitri explained everything with respect and submission.
Moreover, his coming to the Horde was a mark of his faithfulness. He might refer to
this, and, of course, he was not silent; he said that he submitted to the will of
the Khan; that he acknowledged the primacy of Yuri, the proof of which was that he
had given him the tribute of Tver, those two thousand grievens which Yuri had not
paid at the Horde, as was shown when officials sought for an account of them.
</p>
<p>Yuri perhaps had no thought of withholding this tribute; circumstances may have prevented
his going immediately to the Horde with it, for soon after he received the money he
was forced to hasten to Novgorod, and farther, since at that time he was fighting
fiercely against the Swedes and the Germans of Riga, and he had not yet returned from
that distant campaigning. Still, as was thought at the Horde, it was not the right
way to act, and command was given straightway to summon Yuri. To Dmitri Uzbek was
more gracious than he had ever been to any prince. Surprised by his daring speech,
the Khan gave him honor. Mongol magnates, in view of this, were full of respect for
him, and his success was immediate. Yuri was summoned once more to the Horde. Dmitri
received his patent, not as Prince of Tver, but as Grand Prince, and the Khan sent
his envoy, Svinche Buga, and a Mongol detachment of warriors to <span class="corr" id="xd32e2670" title="Source: instal">install</span> the new favorite. Such double rule under Mongol direction was not a new thing.
</p>
<p>From the winter of 1322 to that of 1324, no man among the Russians knew positively
whether Yuri or Dmitri was Grand Prince. Both ruled in the Khan’s name, and each held
his patent. Yuri, meanwhile, was defending Novgorod against Swedes, and meeting also
Tver regiments led against him by Alexander, a brother of the Terrible-Eyed Dmitri.
Yuri defeated the Swedes at that point where the Neva flows out of Lake Ladoga, and
made a “permanent peace” with them. When he had finished with the Swedes, he prepared
to assuage the Khan’s anger. Some time before he had begged his brother, Ivan, to
defend him at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb311">[<a href="#pb311">311</a>]</span>Horde. No man was better fitted to do this than Ivan, and he succeeded. It is true
that when he came home to Moscow the Khan’s envoy came also to confirm the summons
to Yuri, but in every case Yuri’s safety at the Horde seemed more than likely.
</p>
<p>Though satisfied by the news which Ivan brought, Yuri still hesitated over the risks
of the journey. He made repeated inquiries of friends at the Horde as to what might
await him, and learned that he could go with good chances of security. He did not
go empty-handed, moreover, knowing well that success at Sarai was connected at all
times with an abundance of silver and gold. He went at the same time with envoys from
Novgorod. Dmitri had beset all the roads to the Volga; he was determined to prevent
Yuri’s visit to the Horde. Hence the Grand Prince was forced to go by Vyatka to Perm,
thence down the Kama to the Volga, and thus he reached Sarai finally.
</p>
<p>In 1325, when most men knew not what had happened to Yuri, news came that he was in
good health at the court of his brother-in-law. Dmitri, astonished that his enemy
had escaped unpunished, set out for the Horde to work against him. All were now waiting
in Russia to see which of the two men would come back as Grand Prince; neither came.
First Yuri’s corpse was brought to Moscow November 21, 1325, and it was learned that
Dmitri and Yuri, having been summoned to Uzbek’s presence, had met in his palace.
Dmitri could not restrain himself. He drew his sword instantly, and Yuri fell, slain
by the avenging hand of Michael’s son. “A deed like this done near the eyes of the
Khan, and almost in his presence, is not to be pardoned!” cried the Mongols. Uzbek
ordered all to be silent. When news of this order came to Russia, men thought that
Yuri’s death had been pleasing to Uzbek. But when they learned later that it had happened
without the Khan’s desire or knowledge, Dmitri’s friends were greatly troubled.
</p>
<p>During more than nine months the Khan’s will in this case was not uttered, and some
had good hopes for Dmitri, but on September 15, 1326, Dmitri was executed, and the
body of the Tver prince was taken to his native city, where they placed it at the
side of Prince Michael, his father.
</p>
<p>Though Uzbek had ordered the execution of Dmitri, Alexander, Dmitri’s brother, was
made Grand Prince. But Alexander’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb312">[<a href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>power was not lasting. Before twelve months had passed it had ended.
</p>
<p>In 1327, Uzbek sent Cholkhan, his cousin, to Tver. With him came warriors, princes
and merchants. Cholkhan occupied Alexander’s palace, and his warriors were quartered
on the people. They committed violence, as was usual on every such occasion, and there
was much feeling against them in Tver. It was reported among Russians that the Mongols
intended to kill the Tver prince, his friends, and his family, and clear the throne
for Cholkhan, who would at once put Mongol princes in every part of Russia, and force
his religion on Christians.
</p>
<p>Early one morning a deacon was leading to water a young mare in good flesh; some Mongols
rushed to take the beast from him,—they wished to kill, cook, and eat her. The deacon
struggled and shouted; people ran up to help him; more Mongols hurried to the spot,
and a fight began which developed and extended till it filled the city. Church bells
were tolled. Cholkhan was roused and rushed forth to the battle. At sunrise all Tver
was raging in a desperate conflict. The Grand Prince himself took part, and pushed
into the thickest of the struggle. Both sides fought all day fiercely, and only toward
evening did Alexander force Cholkhan and his men to the palace, where the Mongols
quickly barred every entrance. But Alexander did not spare his father’s palace; he
fired it with his own hands, and Cholkhan and his Mongols were burned to death in
it. All Mongol merchants were slain; the Tver men spared not one of them; even those
who had lived a long time in the city received neither quarter nor mercy. They were
burned in their houses, or drowned in the river.
</p>
<p>Such was the punishment inflicted on Cholkhan, Uzbek’s cousin. When Uzbek heard of
this massacre, his anger blazed up furiously against the rebels, and in grief over
Cholkhan. He sent at once for the Prince of Moscow. Ivan delayed not. It seems that
his obedience and ready arrival at Sarai surprised even the Khan. Ivan found every
one in great alarm. The Mongols thought that all Russia had risen in revolt and refused
further obedience. When the true condition was explained, Uzbek gave the Moscow prince
a part of his army to punish the insolent Tver men. He sent with him also Mongol princes
and five commanders, each leading ten thousand warriors. In fact he gave an army <span class="pageNum" id="pb313">[<a href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>sufficient to conquer a kingdom. His order was to destroy the Tver principality.
</p>
<p>No man had ever seen Uzbek in such convulsions of anger. He roared like a lion. Not
a Tver prince was to be left alive. The whole Russian land must be harassed. Ivan
was to slaughter his own countrymen to avenge Mongols. Vassili, a Ryazan prince summoned
recently for judgment, was beheaded at once. Later on, when Mongol warriors were at
work, the head of another prince fell at the Khan’s capital. During the summer of
1328, there was great bloodshed throughout all Vladimir. The legions which came with
Ivan, led by Turlyak, were so numerous that no Russian power could withstand them.
Tver and other towns were leveled. All people who did not flee were either slain or
taken captive. Alexander and his brothers fled to Novgorod, but Novgorod, greatly
alarmed, would not allow them to remain in the city, and they fled to Pskoff. When
the Khan’s warriors approached Novgorod, Ivan sent envoys from himself and Turlyak.
The Novgorod men showed the envoys all honor, paid tribute and made presents. The
city sent then an embassy to Uzbek, and implored Ivan to conduct it. “Go thou to the
Horde,” begged they, “and declare the obedience of Novgorod.” The prince consented.
Constantine of Tver, Ivan’s cousin, joined the embassy, for Ivan had promised to intercede
in his favor.
</p>
<p>It would be difficult to estimate what suffering that outbreak in Tver brought on
Russia; how much torture and anguish that desperate affair cost the people. The Khan
was waiting for news with impatience; when it came, it was so terrible that he was
satisfied. The smoking ruins of Tver towns and settlements seemed to him a splendid
reminder and a hint strong enough to keep down the disobedient. Tver, Kashin, and
all towns in Torjok and the Tver principality were turned into ashes. People had been
destroyed or taken captive wherever hands or weapons could reach them. Only those
who fled to gloomy forests, where they hid among wild beasts, survived that dreadful
visitation. In time they came back to their places, and began to work anew, but all
were in dire need and poverty, for their lands were as a desert.
</p>
<p>The campaign successfully ended, the Mongols went home with much wealth and many captives.
They not only seized cattle, <span class="pageNum" id="pb314">[<a href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>horses, and property, but took the wives and daughters of Russians, and the men who
were able to labor. They took everything that pleased them, wherever they found it.
Those who complained or resisted were cut to pieces immediately. But Moscow and all
its lands were free from Mongol rapacity and massacre.
</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1328, Ivan went to the Horde to report that the Khan’s demand was
accomplished. With him were the Novgorod envoys and Feodor Kolenitsa, their chief
man, also Constantine, the Tver prince. Uzbek met all very graciously, and received
Ivan with much honor. He gave him the Grand Principality, adding lands also to Moscow,
and granting everything that the prince asked for; he gratified Kolenitsa as well.
But he commanded them all to the last man to seek out Alexander and bring him to the
Horde to receive the Khan’s sentence.
</p>
<p>After the countless quarrels between princes, and the Mongol raids which did not cease
for even one year during five decades after the death of Alexander Nevski, the peace
which now began, when Nevski’s grandson, Ivan, became Grand Prince of Vladimir, must
have seemed a miracle. And for many a day it remained in the minds of the people as
a wonderful benefaction. This lasting peace was the great event of Ivan’s reign. All
knew that he had Uzbek’s confidence. Russian princes saw that the Khan granted whatever
Ivan asked of him. They saw this even before, but when Constantine, brother of the
fugitive Alexander, was confirmed in Tver through Ivan’s influence, all were convinced
of Uzbek’s friendship for him, none more firmly than the Novgorod envoys, who had
visited the Horde with the Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>In 1328, upon his return from Sarai, Ivan and the other princes met in Novgorod, for
they had to find Alexander. They decided to send envoys to that prince, and say, “The
Khan summons thee to judgment; wilt thou suffer for the Russian land like a warrior
of Christ, or survive alone, and give the whole Russian land to destruction?” The
envoys returned with the declaration that the Pskoff men would not yield Alexander.
They had agreed and kissed the cross not to forsake him. He and they would stand or
fall in one company. The princes moved now on Pskoff with strong forces. Besides Ivan’s
army, he commanded Tver troops with the troops of other princes, and men of Novgorod
also. Wishing no harm to Pskoff, he pitched his camp at some distance <span class="pageNum" id="pb315">[<a href="#pb315">315</a>]</span>and negotiated. He sent the Novgorod bishop with the Novgorod commander to the prince,
and strove to act with kindness. Alexander was moved to tears and answered that he
was willing to stand before Uzbek, but the Pskoff men swore that they would not allow
him to go from their city. Alexander sent this message from himself: “It is better
that I die for all, than that all should perish for me. But ye might defend your own
brothers and not yield them to pagans. Ye do just the opposite, and with you ye bring
Mongols.”
</p>
<p>“It is impossible to take the prince from Pskoff or drive him from the city.” These
words were current in the camp of the allies. Ivan knew much more of the true state
of affairs than could be gathered from camp reports, or the words of Alexander. He
knew that Pskoff hoped to be independent of Novgorod, that it wished for its own prince,
and thought that it had one now in Alexander. He knew also that Livonia supported
the city in secret, understanding well that if alone it would be weaker and more easily
subjected, while Lithuania supported Pskoff openly and roused the city to resistance.
Alexander, consciously or not, was the helper of Gedimin. Ivan knew, perhaps, of a
treaty made by Pskoff and Alexander with Livonia. “The Germans are near them, and
they expect aid from them,” said Ivan in council. It was difficult for him to act.
In those straits he remembered that when Yuri, his brother, was struggling with Tver,
Maxim, the metropolitan, made peace at the outset. There was still another case, even
more memorable. At the time when Dmitri of the Terrible Eyes, intending to war against
Yuri, was leading his troops to Nizni, and had reached Vladimir, Pyotr, the bishop,
stopped him by refusing to give him his blessing, and Dmitri, after waiting three
weeks, returned home without meeting Yuri. Ivan turned now to Feognost, the metropolitan,
and begged for his assistance.
</p>
<p>Feognost consented immediately, and was ready to utter a curse on the Pskoff prince
if he would not stand before Uzbek, and on all the Pskoff people unless they surrendered
him. Envoys were sent to the city declaring that unless they submitted an interdict
would be issued, and services stopped in the churches. All people would be excommunicated.
</p>
<p>“Brothers and friends,” said Alexander to the people, on hearing <span class="pageNum" id="pb316">[<a href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>this message, “let your oath to me, and my oath to you lose their value. I will go
from your city so that no harm may strike you. I will find refuge with the Germans
or in Lithuania,” and he departed. Pskoff then informed Ivan that Alexander was no
longer with them, and added: “Pskoff pays thee homage as its Grand Prince.”
</p>
<p>Thus Ivan was the first Moscow prince who gave peace to Pskoff in the old fashion,
as he would to his own principality. The metropolitan blessed the Pskoff people, and
Ivan marched homeward with the princes. After Ivan had reached Moscow, Gedimin proposed
that Novgorod should take as prince his son Narimont, and give him Oraihovo and Ladoga,
with a part of Karelia, as inheritance. Moscow learned then for the first time that
since Ivan had left Pskoff, Alexander had returned, and was prince there, supported
by Gedimin. It was not this return alone which roused Novgorod, but the treason of
the Pskoff men. The city had accepted Alexander as prince from Lithuania, and were
striving now for church separation. When Vassili, the new archbishop, went from Novgorod
for ordination, Gedimin of Lithuania and Alexander of Pskoff sent envoys to Feognost,
Metropolitan of Russia, then in Volynia. These envoys took with them Arseni to be
bishop in Pskoff. Gedimin had given Pskoff a prince in Alexander, and would now give
a bishop. Feognost ordained Vassili as Archbishop of Novgorod, but refused to ordain
Arseni, and Alexander’s envoys returned without a bishop. Gedimin, enraged by the
Novgorod success, and the failure of Arseni, sent men to seize Vassili, but, warned
by a messenger from Feognost, he escaped the Lithuanians, and returned in safety to
Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Alexander managed Pskoff for ten years, while Constantine and Vassili, his brothers,
ruled the Tver region,—the first in Tver, the chief city, the second in Kashin in
the northern part of the Tver principality. Ivan had reconciled the Tver princes with
Uzbek, and as they were friendly and obedient their position was easy. Ivan asked
of them only to leave the road free between Moscow and Novgorod,—Tver held the way
between those two cities. Vladimir, the capital of the principality, was occupied
by Alexander, the Suzdal prince, not as a capital, but as a possession. Ivan lived
at all times in Moscow, which had become the real capital of Russia. Uzbek, as stated
already, gave him many <span class="pageNum" id="pb317">[<a href="#pb317">317</a>]</span>lands in addition, giving Vladimir meanwhile to the Suzdal prince.
</p>
<p>Several princes found themselves tied to Ivan through relationship. He gave one of
his daughters to Vassili, Prince of Yaroslavl, another to Constantine of Rostoff.
Those princes, fearing to disobey their father-in-law, had worked with him loyally
thus far.
</p>
<p>Besides having the Khan’s confidence, Ivan was strong through the tribute. No other
Grand Prince had given the Khan such an income; and no prince held such uncontrolled
management of tribute. This gave Ivan unique power and position. Of all princes in
that day he was the only one, or at least the only one known to us, who had a fixed
object. He took no part in local quarrels in favor of one or another region. He strove
for Russia, and when prince only in Moscow he saw all Russia far in the future. This
was clearly shown in his every act, not merely in the title which he assumed, “Grand
Prince of Moscow and All Russia,” but in his relations with other princes and with
Novgorod, and even with Uzbek. To preserve the Russian land in its integrity was,
by the very working of fate, to preserve the Khan’s lordship, and support it for a
season. There is no doubt that Ivan explained always to Uzbek the harmful growth of
Lithuania, and as he himself warred with that power, so he roused Uzbek to war with
it. He showed the Khan, too, the immense wealth of Novgorod in the distant lands of
the East and the Pechora, to which Novgorod admitted no Grand Prince. Uzbek rewarded
and honored his untiring assistant, and Ivan all the more easily reached his object,
calling himself with deep reason Grand Prince, not of Moscow alone, but of all Russia.
</p>
<p>Throughout his whole reign, Ivan had no personal quarrels; he deprived no prince of
his inheritance, he made war on no rival. Still he kept all in obedience. At that
epoch Alexander, the Tver prince, was beyond doubt the most important of the princes.
Owing to Ivan’s non-interference, Alexander reigned ten years in Pskoff without annoyance;
neither with arms nor with words did Ivan disturb him, but he watched Alexander’s
connections with Gedimin and with Livonia, and forgot no intrigue of his.
</p>
<p>Novgorod, fearing the power of Ivan, sought his good-will, offered friendship, and
did not refuse to send Moscow more tribute than it had sent Vladimir. As Prince of
Novgorod he might have been satisfied with the tribute, and the honor with <span class="pageNum" id="pb318">[<a href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>which Novgorod strove to placate him, but as chief of all Russia he was not content
with this; he demanded what the city owed to all Russia. Ivan would never yield to
Novgorod when it claimed single ownership of regions beyond the Volok, nor would he
pardon its boyars for threatening to favor Lithuania. On those points he warred with
the city at all times. During his reign he made Novgorod feel very clearly that he
did not ask an extra thousand of grievens to build up Moscow, but that the boundaries
fixed from the days of Yuri Dolgoruki, Andrei Bogolyubski, and Big Nest must be given
to Vladimir. Besides he showed the Novgorod men that not to their city alone, but
to all Russia, was open the road to the whole northern country. And the region beyond
the Ural Mountains, the Kamen, as it was then called (beyond the Kamen meant Siberia)
was, as Ivan considered it, the property, not of Novgorod alone, but of all Russia.
Novgorod, however, insisted most stubbornly that those regions belonged to her exclusively.
The Moscow prince would not concede this claim, and watched with the utmost care those
relations which then began between Novgorod and Lithuania.
</p>
<p>The boyars of Novgorod not only considered that they had a right to invite a prince
from Lithuania, but apparently they were ready to place Novgorod under Lithuanian
protection, if thus they could keep independent of other princes, and preserve to
their city those rich, boundless lands on the north and the east.
</p>
<p>Ivan would not admit for a moment that they had the right to call in a foreign prince,
or owned exclusively those lands which they claimed for their own.
</p>
<p>In 1332, when returning from the Horde, Ivan made a demand in the name of the Khan
to which the people of Novgorod gave a stern refusal. He insisted, and to make sure
of their compliance he seized the Upper Baijets and Torjok immediately. From that
began a long quarrel. At times Novgorod seemed to yield, and the quarrel apparently
ceased; again it would blaze up on the city’s renewed refusal. Thus the dispute continued
during Ivan’s reign.
</p>
<p>The main cause of the dispute was the silver beyond the Ural Mountains. Ivan demanded
from Novgorod an income from places claimed by the city, no part of which income should
go to any prince ruling in Novgorod. He wished to extend taxes over all Novgorod possessions
to the boundaries of Siberia.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb319">[<a href="#pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>In proportion as Novgorod quarreled with Ivan, it tried to be intimate with Pskoff.
Vassili, the archbishop, having added stone walls to the Kremlin of Novgorod, found
it proper to visit Pskoff and give the people his blessing, withheld since his installation,
at which time he had opposed Pskoff’s efforts to separate from the diocese. A son
had just been born to Alexander. The bishop baptized him, and was one of the godfathers
of this little prince, named for his grandfather, Michael.
</p>
<p>At that time Novgorod had entered into friendship with Lithuania, and Narimont, son
of Gedimin, had arrived in the city. Novgorod received him with gladness, and gave
him Ladoga with Oraihova and Karelia in part as a portion. In view of these acts Ivan
went to Sarai, and when he came back it was stated that he had been shown great honor,
and had gained large accessions of power while with Uzbek. This alarmed Novgorod.
During Ivan’s absence the Novgorod archbishop had gone on a visit to Moscow, bearing
gifts from the city to the metropolitan, who had just come from Tsargrad. The archbishop
begged the metropolitan to speak with Ivan about Novgorod. This intercession succeeded,
for when envoys arrived in Moscow and invited Ivan to Novgorod, he set aside his dislike
for the city, entered Novgorod February 16, 1335, and was received there in triumph.
They offered to add all their forces to his, and fall upon Pskoff if he so ordered.
But he would not attack Pskoff at that period; he accepted their service, however,
and marched on Lithuania. His forces, and those of the city, took towns in good number,
and though this Lithuanian campaign was not the most important in conquest, it was
in agreement.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gedimin’s son had not justified Novgorod’s hopes in him, and he went back
at last to his father. This freed Ivan’s hands, for he had been gracious to Novgorod
partly because of this young prince’s presence at Ladoga. At this time Novgorod yielded
in many, if not in all things to Ivan. He bought lands where he liked in Novgorod
regions, and founded villages in them, a thing which Novgorod had never permitted
to any prince. Still he yielded no claim touching Russia. The great contention as
to what belonged to Novgorod, and what was all Russia’s dominion was still undecided.
Novgorod now sought again the Pskoff friendship. But the Pskoff men knew well that
Novgorod’s desire <span class="pageNum" id="pb320">[<a href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>for friendship came from dread of Ivan, Prince of Moscow. They knew also that a little
while earlier Novgorod had offered aid against Pskoff, if Ivan wished to have it.
There was no quarrel or hatred on either side at the time of the offer, and it had
been made purely from policy; passion had had nothing to do with the matter.
</p>
<p>If Ivan, as Grand Prince of all Russia, preferred his demands against Novgorod so
insistently, we may understand very well that he was not tender with princes of small
strength. Attendants and boyars of small princes went to serve him by preference,
Moscow’s success was desired by all people who toiled and produced, because order
and quietness came from it. No prince could rival Ivan in power and in resources.
He surpassed not only each Russian prince separately, but he was stronger than any
combination which might be made among them. For long years Ivan had worked at winning
wealth and power. He had worked successfully and with great diligence. Then Uzbek
gave him lands in addition to Moscow, and gave him perfect control of all tribute
from other princes. This made his position unequaled. Ivan now held the purse. He
kept such firm order that merchants felt safe to expose their goods everywhere. New
markets on the Volga and elsewhere were opened. In Northern Russia Yaroslavl, near
the mouth of the Mologa, a river which enters the Volga, was a place where German,
Persian, Greek and Italian merchants met and sold goods during summer. The revenue
from transactions was large. Boats covered the Volga, and till the sixteenth century
this market was an important one in Russia.
</p>
<p>Ivan purchased from poor princes not only villages, but towns such as Uglitch, Bailozersk,
and Galitch beyond the Volga, and thus increased his inheritance unceasingly. He also
bought from boyars and monasteries, and exchanged with them. He received presents
of land and property through wills of friends and relatives. With the wealth which
belonged to him personally, and that which pertained to his office, he was able to
meet all possible demands.
</p>
<p>Responsible to the Khan for Russian tribute, and paying this tribute at regular intervals,
he frequently had to pay for princes who lacked ready money. Of these some grew insolvent
and paid him with land. All, in greater or less degree, were dependent upon him; all
in fact needed his protection. Without regard to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb321">[<a href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>murmurs of Novgorod boyars, he bought towns and villages in Novgorod regions continually.
So, extending power from his capital always with the rights of a Grand Prince, to
which he knew how to give proper emphasis, he was strong at all points, and for many
reasons. Consequently boyars and warriors of weakening principalities went gladly
to the service of Moscow.
</p>
<p>Alexander, Prince of Pskoff for about ten years, was disturbed by no one. It was quite
impossible that the Khan did not know what Alexander was doing, or had forgotten that
Cholkhan, his favorite cousin, had been killed by him. At last Alexander left Pskoff
of his own accord. Lest his son might lose Tver through his father’s exile, he resolved
to appear at the Horde and hear the Khan’s sentence. It was thirteen years since his
first visit, and now he was ten years in disobedience. To the astonishment of Mongol
magnates, and of the Khan himself, Alexander stood before him, not only without trembling,
but with a clear eye; and all were astounded at the words which he uttered:
</p>
<p>“Supreme Sovereign,” said he, “though I have committed much evil, and am guilty before
thee, I have come hither of my own will, and am ready to receive life or death, as
God shall announce to thee. If, for the sake of God, through thy greatness thou give
me pardon, I will thank God and thy grace; if thou give me death, I am worthy of death.”
At this he bowed down, and added, “My head is at thy disposal.”
</p>
<p>For a moment Uzbek was dumb from astonishment, and all present wondered. Alexander
was kneeling with bowed head, and in silence. “See ye,” said Uzbek at last, “how with
obedient wisdom Alexander has saved himself.” The Khan pardoned him straightway, gave
him back the Tver principality, and sent him home without injury.
</p>
<p>But Alexander from the first had an ominous feeling, a presentiment that evil days
were approaching. When the Khan’s officials had installed him, and Abdul, the chief
envoy, was returning to Sarai, “to show the Khan favor,” he took to the Golden Horde
Alexander’s son, Feodor. Soon news came from this prince of fifteen years that for
some unknown reason the Khan was very angry, and would not dismiss him. Alexander
understood then that his son had been taken as a hostage.
</p>
<p>The return of Alexander to Tver signified a return to the old <span class="pageNum" id="pb322">[<a href="#pb322">322</a>]</span>quarrels with Moscow. It meant trouble also in governing. Alexander brought with him
to Tver new boyars and warriors, partly strangers. The chief of these boyars was a
German from Livonia. The Tver boyars were not pleased with this man, or with the return
of Alexander. The Moscow prince, of course, could not expect such relations with Alexander
as with Constantine. The old rivalry was remembered, and with Alexander were renewed
the claims of the Tver principality not to depend on the Prince of all Russia, but
to be quite apart from him and separate. Through this example and also through advice
from Alexander, other princes showed the same tendencies. As soon as Tver had left
that position which for some years it had held toward Ivan, a similar movement appeared
in other places, especially in Yaroslavl, where David, Ivan’s son-in-law, showed clear
disobedience. Unpleasant reports came from Lithuania. It seemed as though Ivan had
lost in one moment, and fatally, all that he had gained step by step for a decade.
Was he now to be Grand Prince of Russia, or was the old rivalry between Moscow and
Tver to begin again? Alexander felt the need of explaining relations with Moscow,
but Ivan avoided discussions of all sorts. Envoys came at last to Ivan from Alexander,
but Ivan would not talk upon any subject with the Tver prince, hence there was no
result from the action of the envoys.
</p>
<p>Ivan went now to the Horde. This visit of his to Uzbek produced on all a peculiar
impression. He took with him his eldest and second sons, Simeon and Ivan; the youngest,
Andrei, he sent to Novgorod. This sending of a son to Novgorod was not without special
meaning. Ivan had remained two years, not in peace, not in war with the city. Lord
Novgorod had not met his demands, and he had not dropped them. By sending Andrei to
the city at this juncture, Ivan reminded Novgorod men once again that he looked on
their capital as his inheritance.
</p>
<p>At Novgorod the usual disorders were active. Gedimin’s son, who had been absent for
a time in Lithuania, had returned, but there was great dissatisfaction with him, for
he did not show sufficient energy in defending their borders against the Swedes.
</p>
<p>Ivan came back from the Horde with added power and new honor. All princes were placed
under his hand still more firmly. It became known very quickly that, owing to Ivan’s
suggestion, <span class="pageNum" id="pb323">[<a href="#pb323">323</a>]</span>the princes were summoned to Sarai to receive the Khan’s commands.
</p>
<p>Alexander knew that now he must go, and that he would never again see Tver. He sent
quickly to his son for any information which he might have regarding the affair. The
tidings which came back were woeful and he hesitated. An envoy now came to Alexander
from the Khan promising him favor, but at the same time reminding him that his son
was held as hostage. If a year before the Tver prince had hastened to the Horde when
he himself was in danger, he hastened all the more now when Feodor was threatened.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ivan had gone to Sarai still a second time, and taken with him his three
sons. Before Alexander’s arrival at the Horde Ivan was back in Moscow, but his sons
had wished to remain with the Khan.
</p>
<p>With Alexander went the princes of Bailozero and Yaroslavl. When the Tver prince approached
the Khan’s capital, his son came to meet him, and with tearful eyes told of Uzbek’s
dreadful anger. “God’s will be done,” said Alexander. “If I do not die now, I shall
die on some other day.” In accord with Mongol custom, he presented rich gifts to the
Khan and his magnates, but the gifts were received in gloomy silence. His offenses
were not declared, nor were questions asked him. It was announced that the Khan had
commanded to give him to death without trial. But till his last day, October 28, 1339,
he enjoyed freedom. That morning he sent to one of the Khan’s wives, who had been
kind to <span class="corr" id="xd32e2760" title="Source: Feoder">Feodor</span>, to learn his fate; then he mounted a horse to make the inquiry in person. She did
not conceal from the prince that his last sun had risen.
</p>
<p>Returning to his tent, Alexander embraced Feodor, and took farewell of his attendants.
He kissed his boyars, asking pardon of all, then he and his son with the boyars took
holy communion. Soon after that they heard the executioners approaching, and Alexander
and Feodor went forth to meet them. The men stripped the clothes from the two princes,
tied their hands, and led them toward Tablubey, the Khan’s magnate, who was present
on horseback. “Kill them!” commanded Tablubey. The executioners hurled the prince
and his son to the earth, beat both with fists, and then, after trampling them to
death, cut their heads off. Alexander’s attendants carried the bodies to Tver.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb324">[<a href="#pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>That winter Ivan’s three sons were sent home in high favor. By command of “the Godless
Uzbek,” adds the chronicler, “the following princes were put to death during that
winter: Feodor of Starodub, Ivan and Vassili of Ryazan, and Alexander Novosilski.<span class="corr" id="xd32e2769" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>The position acquired by Ivan through the favor of Uzbek was evident to all other
princes. They knew, moreover, that after his death no change would be made. Every
measure had been taken to give primacy to his family, and not to another.
</p>
<p>Six months had not passed after the death of Alexander and his son, when Ivan died,
March 31, 1340, being about fifty years of age. He died before his time, and perhaps
unexpectedly, but he was able to go to Spasski, his favorite monastery, and put on
the monk’s habit. He was buried in the Archangel Cathedral, his tomb being the first
in that series of Moscow sovereigns, his descendants.
</p>
<p>Uzbek, besides appreciating Ivan as a servant who was faithful and who worked for
him zealously, liked the man personally. He placed him above all the princes, honored
him in sovereign style, and made him presents. Among those presents was a bag, the
Mongol kalitá, destined to historic celebrity. Of Ivan it was said by those who praised
him that to the poor he stretched a hand which was never empty; that whenever he went
from his palace he filled his kalitá with coins and gave them to the poor whom he
met in his progress. “Not precious the gift,” says the proverb, “but precious the
love which goes with it,” and Ivan Kalitá, as people came to call him from the gift
of the Khan which ever afterward he used so constantly, gave his coins affably, for
he liked much to give to the needy. The kalitá which he had received from Uzbek’s
own hands might be considered emblematic of his leading activity and methods. Though
one use of this kalitá was to carry coins for the needy, Ivan’s purse had other uses.
It was the clearing house of Russia in his day. Into it flowed the tribute and taxes;
out of it went the sums for which account was imperative; with him remained for use
in his struggle for supremacy all profits and remnants of every kind. One of the most
important acts of Ivan’s life was the removal of the religious capital of Russia from
Vladimir to Moscow. During his pastoral visits, Peter of Lithuania, at that time metropolitan,
came to Moscow frequently, and conceived a friendship for Ivan. Later he spent all
of his time in Moscow, where he died and was buried. His last words to Kalitá were:
“If <span class="pageNum" id="pb325">[<a href="#pb325">325</a>]</span>you obey me, my son, you will build a church here and give repose to my bones in your
city. You and your sons and your grandsons will thus gain more fame than all the other
princes, and this place will be renowned. The pastors of the church will dwell in
it, and it will be above all other cities.” The church was built. The succeeding metropolitan
would not desert the house and tomb of the holy Peter, and Moscow became the center
of religious administration.
</p>
<p>During 1340 died Ivan Kalitá, Gedimin, and Uzbek Khan of the Golden Horde, three men
who left profound traces in Russia.
</p>
<p>Before touching on Gedimin, we must give some account of his dynasty. In the district
of Kovno, on the right bank of the Dubissa, is a place called Eiragola. In the thirteenth
century there was a small wooden castle in Eiragola, and from that castle came the
Lithuanian princes. The first noted man of this line was Mindog; the first great one
was Gedimin. Mindog was sure of success in that place and epoch. He was a man for
whom all means were equally good, if equally effective. He had only one way of judging
an action,—might it be of use to him, and had he power to commit it?
</p>
<p>When Batu had conquered Eastern Russia, the Lithuanian princes fell to raiding the
west of that country, but in 1246, while returning from a raid, they were overtaken
near Pinsk and scattered by Daniel of Galitch and his brother, Vassilko. The next
year, another such party was crushed by those same princes.
</p>
<p>In 1252, Mindog sent Vykint, his uncle, and two nephews, Tovtivil and Edivil, to attack
Smolensk places, and to ravage the country. “Let each of you keep what he wins,” said
he at parting. But these words were used simply to mislead and deceive his three relatives.
As soon as they had gone, Mindog seized their possessions, and sent warriors to follow
and kill them. They heard of this treachery in season, and took refuge quickly with
Daniel, who had married the sister of Tovtivil and Edivil. Mindog sent at once to
Daniel, asking him not to assist them, but Daniel paid no heed to this message; first
through regard for his wife’s brothers and her uncle, and second because he wished
to weaken Mindog and his people. After counseling with Vassilko, Daniel formed a plan.
He sent to Polish princes this message: “It is time for us to fall upon pagans, since
they are warring against one another.” He sent similar messages to the Yatvyags, to
Jmud, and to the Germans in Riga.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb326">[<a href="#pb326">326</a>]</span></p>
<p>Vykint, Daniel’s envoy, roused the Yatvyags, and half the Jmud region. The Germans
sent this answer to Daniel: “Though Vykint, thy relative, has killed many of our men,
we have made peace with him, and will assist you.” The brothers now set out to make
war in earnest. Daniel sent Vassilko to Volkovisk, his son to Slonim, and then marched
to Zditov. They captured many towns and returned to Galitch well satisfied. After
that, he sent Tovtivil with Russians and Polovtsi against Mindog. The Germans made
no move whatever, until Tovtivil went to Riga, where he received baptism from them;
then they made ready for action.
</p>
<p>Mindog saw that he could not meet two foes in one conflict. He could not war with
the Germans and Daniel of Galitch at the same time. Hence he sent secretly rich gifts
to the Grand Master Von Schtükland, and the following proposal: “If thou kill Tovtivil
or expel him, thou wilt get still greater gifts from me.” Von Schtükland replied that
he felt immense friendship for Mindog, but could give no aid till baptism had changed
him. Mindog asked for a meeting, which was granted, and he settled the question while
feasting with Von Schtükland. The Lithuanian prince was to be baptized. On hearing
this news, the Pope was delighted, and wrote to the bishop that no one should offend
the new convert. The Bishop of Culm was to crown him.
</p>
<p>But Mindog was forced to Christianity under the sword-blade, just as the Prussians
had been forced to it earlier, and had gone back to the faith of their fathers whenever
the chance came. Mindog, however, escaped all the dangers which threatened him from
the Order. Tovtivil fled to Vykint, his uncle. He assembled warriors from the Yatvyags
and Jmud, and, aided by warriors from Daniel, marched against Mindog assisted now
by the Germans.
</p>
<p>During 1252, the war was not marked by notable action, but in 1253 Daniel took part
in it personally, and with such success that Mindog asked for peace. He offered his
daughter to Daniel’s son, Svaromir, and found still other means of persuasion.
</p>
<p>Tovtivil declared now that Mindog had bribed the Yatvyags, who refused to assist Daniel
longer. Daniel was enraged at the Yatvyags, but that could not serve him. Two years
passed. In 1255, there was peace between Daniel of Galitch and Mindog’s son, Voishelk.
Voishelk was a man greatly noted, even in that <span class="pageNum" id="pb327">[<a href="#pb327">327</a>]</span>time of bloodshed. Mindog was cruel and terrible, but Voishelk surpassed him, if the
annalist is truthful. Voishelk shed blood from his youth up. “Every day he killed
three or four men for amusement. When his time passed without bloodshed, he was sad,
and when he had killed a man, good feeling returned to him.”
</p>
<p>All at once news came of Voishelk’s baptism; nay, more, it was said that he had left
ruling, and had put on a monk’s habit. This man now appeared as a peacemaker between
Daniel and Mindog. The conditions seemed so favorable that Daniel did not reject them.
Daniel’s son, Svaromir (familiarly Shvarn), was to marry Mindog’s daughter; Shvarn’s
elder brother, Roman, was to have Novgrodek from Mindog, and Daniel was to get Slonim
and Volkovisk from Voishelk, on condition of recognizing Mindog as his superior in
those places.
</p>
<p>Mindog had promised the Order to accept its religion for himself and all the people
under him. He was to receive the friendship of the Order, and the kingly office as
a reward. In exchange, he was to give the Order various places in Jmud, those same
places where there had been such terrible bloodshed because of newcomers fleeing from
Prussia. The friendship seemed to be made for the ages, and a speedy union of the
two lands appeared imminent. In case that he had no heir, Mindog agreed to give his
kingdom to Livonia, now of one faith with him.
</p>
<p>The Bishop of Culm came with priests and monks; the Grand Master with knights of the
Order. Mindog was christened, anointed, and crowned at Novgrodek. Pope Innocent&nbsp;IV
in 1255 blessed the new convert to war against Russia and its inhabitants who were
schismatic, and confirmed in advance to him all regions which he might join to his
kingdom.
</p>
<p>“The God-Crowned King,” as he was entitled, freed himself gradually from every one.
From Tovtivil he freed himself by perfidy; from the Yatvyags by money, from Daniel
through marriage and lands, from Poland by victories. One Polish prince was slain
in battle, another was captured. Then the Knights of Livonia discovered what kind
of man their good friend and new convert was. Mindog turned on them and fought like
a hero. He sent a message stating that he dropped them and their baptism. He roused
Jmud to the struggle, and those people whom he had so recently surrendered to the
Order rose up against it in pitiless <span class="pageNum" id="pb328">[<a href="#pb328">328</a>]</span>warfare. To one who did not understand Mindog’s keen policy, it might seem strange
that he should show such hatred for his godfathers, and should openly irritate the
Order. The Germans, however, knew from the first that his conversion was feigned for
the purpose of obtaining aid.
</p>
<p>He did not cease to observe the ancient rites of his people; he made sacrifices to
their deities, but for him that was not sufficient. He was a shrewd leader of men;
he had also learned the policy of Germans. It was necessary to fire the hearts of
his people, and to purify himself perfectly from any taint of German religion, hence
before Lithuanians he ridiculed his own pretended conversion.
</p>
<p>The Germans made war on him promptly, but were defeated. Mindog, in celebrating his
victory, made a great sacrifice. It was not enough for him to burn bulls and horses;
he took one of the knights whom he had captured and burned him on horseback in complete
battle armor, as an offering.
</p>
<p>After the marriage of his daughter to Daniel’s son, Mindog sustained friendly relations
with Russia. He made more than one campaign with Daniel and Vassilko against the Yatvyags
and disobedient Lithuanians, and against the Poles, and princes of Northern Russia.
He went against the Livonian Knights to fight Riga. When Daniel became a widower,
he married a niece of Mindog. Mindog had power now, but he had become too important
for his family. His relatives were enraged at his haughtiness; they would not permit
him to so exalt himself, and though he was the single ruler of all Lithuania, they
ceased not to plan his death. At last personal hatred subdued the man.
</p>
<p>Mindog’s wife died in 1262, and he grieved much. To her sister, the wife of Prince
Dovmont, he sent this message: “Thy sister is dead; come to see us.” When she came,
Mindog said: “When dying, thy sister commanded me to marry thee, that her children
might not be tormented.” And he took his sister-in-law as wife.
</p>
<p>Dovmont, in deep anger, planned to kill Mindog. Seeking an ally, he found one in Trenyat,
the Jmud prince. In 1263, Mindog sent all his troops against Roman of Bryansk, who
ruled east of the Dnieper. Dovmont was in that expedition. While on the road he declared
to the leaders that a wizard had warned him <span class="pageNum" id="pb329">[<a href="#pb329">329</a>]</span>not to advance farther, and leaving the army, he returned straightway to Mindog’s
castle, where he killed him and his two sons.
</p>
<p>Trenyat, very likely through a bargain with Dovmont, began to reign in Lithuania in
place of Mindog, and also in Jmud, and sent to Tovtivil of Polotsk, his brother, saying:
“Come at once; we will seize the whole land and all Mindog’s substance.”
</p>
<p>The division caused a quarrel. Tovtivil began to think how to kill Trenyat, and Trenyat
how to be rid of his brother. Tovtivil’s boyar informed Trenyat of the prince’s designs.
Trenyat, being quicker than Tovtivil, killed him and reigned unassisted, but his reign
was not long. Four of Mindog’s equerries, to avenge their late prince, murdered Trenyat.
</p>
<p>Voishelk, when he learned of his father’s death, went to Minsk, but when he heard
that Trenyat had been assassinated, he set out with Pinsk forces for Novgrodek, and
from there, taking more warriors, he went to Lithuania, where his father’s adherents
received him most joyfully. He began to reign, and as if to make men forget that he
had ever worn a monk’s habit, he fell to slaying his enemies wherever he found them.
In his new rôle of avenger he surpassed himself. Along the Nieman and all the Jmud
boundaries Voishelk shed blood for the death of his father. When he had restored what
had been taken from Mindog’s possessions, and extended them, and had almost exterminated
his father’s enemies, he yielded all to his brother-in-law. He wished to be a monk
and retire to Mount Athos. No matter how Shvarn begged, he would not remain, he would
have no earthly dominion. “I have sinned much before God and man,” replied Voishelk.
“Do thou rule; the land is in peace now.”
</p>
<p>This was the year that Daniel of Galitch died, and shortly before his decease Voishelk
asked him for a safe-conduct to Mount Athos. But as there was war in Bulgaria, the
would-be monk was forced to turn back without seeing the holy mountain. He settled
then in Volynia, built a monastery, and passed the remainder of his life in seclusion.
</p>
<p>Voishelk and Dovmont are considered as cousins. The fate of the two is remarkable;
one became a monk, the other a warrior. Dovmont fled from civil war in Lithuania,
taking his troops with him. He was baptized in Pskoff and married the daughter of
Prince Dmitri, son of Nevski. He became a great favorite of his <span class="pageNum" id="pb330">[<a href="#pb330">330</a>]</span>father-in-law. Pskoff was thereafter safe, not only from Lithuanian raids, but from
the Knights of Livonia, whom he drove from the walls of the city and followed into
the depths of the forests. Though Dovmont fought many battles he never lost one, and
he governed the Pskoff people with firmness and wisdom. Voishelk assumed the monk’s
habit, but the habit and the building of a monastery were accounted as nothing to
Voishelk, while Dovmont’s sword is held sacred in Pskoff, even to our day.
</p>
<p>Lithuania fell back into anarchy. There were continual struggles between the descendants
of Mindog and other princes, who would not accept their supremacy, and no distinguished
man appeared until Gedimin. In 1315 Gedimin replaced Viten, and about this time died
Yuri Lvovitch, the grandson of Daniel and the last prince of both Galitch and Volynia.
</p>
<p>In 1316 Andrei and Lev, the two sons of Yuri, divided Volynia and Galitch between
them. But the great Roman’s inheritance was of small use to those, his weak and last
male descendants. Those two sons of Yuri Lvovitch had each a daughter, one of whom
married the Mazovian prince, Troiden; the other married Lyubart, a son of Gedimin.
Lyubart received Volynia with his princess and laid claim to Galitch. So the Lithuania
of Gedimin’s day was increased by almost the whole of South Russia.
</p>
<p>Rome, meanwhile, did not cease to consider Lithuania as one of its bishoprics. The
churches of Livonia and Lithuania were spoken of as neighboring churches, and the
Pope acted in Lithuania through Livonia. But about the time Gedimin began to rule,
a dispute was raging between the knights and the Bishop of Riga. The bishop complained
to the Pope that the knights, by their greed, love of power, and savage treatment,
turned people away from Christianity. The knights declared that the bishops, in dealing
with conquered people, influenced them against the knights and encouraged them in
paganism. They proved to the Pope that the Bishop of Riga had invited the people more
than once to act against the Order; that the bishops negotiated in secret with Lithuanian
princes and extended their influence over the people; that they acted in spite of
the Order, and used the Order only when they had need of its services. In view of
such contradictory statements, the Pope took sometimes the side of the bishop, and
sometimes the side of the Order, not hindering either side, <span class="pageNum" id="pb331">[<a href="#pb331">331</a>]</span>however, in continuing the “sacred work” of converting the infidels.
</p>
<p>Through the Bishop of Riga the Pope received in 1323 a message from Gedimin stating
that he was ready for baptism, as were all people under him. He asked that the knights
be prevented from making war on Lithuania, and declared that the Order had stopped
him from having relations directly with the Curia; that they helped in no way to Christianize
people.
</p>
<p>At the same time letters went to the Franciscans and Dominicans in Riga, requesting
that monks be sent to Lithuania. Letters were sent also to Germany with offers of
free trade, and asking for colonists. The Pope was delighted with the letter from
Gedimin, and commanded the Order to stop warlike action in view of Lithuania’s conversion.
The Archbishop of Riga made a friendly alliance with Gedimin, and the Order was forced
to join also.
</p>
<p>In due time envoys appeared from Rome, and when they had confirmed all agreements
between Lithuania and Livonia, they set out to find Gedimin and establish the Catholic
faith in his capital and elsewhere. They intended to baptize and crown the Lithuanian
prince, and then baptize all his subjects, but this they were unable to do.
</p>
<p>In Vilna they found things very different from what they had expected. They found
great hatred for the German religion; they found, to their astonishment, Orthodox
churches; they found also that the heathen Lithuanians not only threatened to hurl
Gedimin from power if he tried to baptize them, but to exterminate his whole family.
They saw that all Jmud and the Prussians would rise if Gedimin endeavored to bring
in the German religion. Besides this, Gedimin’s Russian Orthodox subjects formed three-fourths
of the whole population; they also threatened loudly. Thus opposed on two sides, his
position would have been difficult had he really wished to introduce the German religion.
Gedimin had been christened in the Orthodox faith, whether through conviction or policy
we may not determine at this day, but his motives must have been overwhelming, either
to remain pagan or become Orthodox. He sent the legates away. They went back enraged
and indignant at the faith-breaking ruler. But Gedimin found no fault in himself;
he found it on the other side. Each side accused the other, but it was difficult to
tell which was the more perfidious. <span class="pageNum" id="pb332">[<a href="#pb332">332</a>]</span>Illiterate Lithuania carried on its home correspondence in Russian, but with Rome
and the West the Livonian Germans helped Gedimin in Latin, and he had monks for that
purpose from Vilna. It proved that those zealous aids, in their Latin letters sent
to Rome by the way of Riga, had written much over Gedimin’s name which he would not
acknowledge. In every case, when thunders struck him from the Vatican, and throughout
Western Europe men called him a preternatural deceiver and liar, a forerunner of Antichrist,
who trampled on laws divine and human, Gedimin justified himself, saying that the
Latin writers had not correctly translated his words; he had never uttered the words
which they had written.
</p>
<p>The German now became more troublesome than ever. Gedimin was forced to perpetual
conflict with his neighbors. The knights, warring continually on the banks of the
Niemen, made their attacks in the form of excursions, which they called “journeys.”
Men came in large numbers from every part of the Holy Roman Empire to join those excursions.
In 1336 there came of simple knights about two hundred counts and princes, and the
Grand Master formed for their amusement what might be called a great pagan hunt.
</p>
<p>Like the founder of Riga, his successor, the Grand Master did not cease to baptize
pagan people, who later on complained to all Europe in these words: “Listen to us,
O princes spiritual and secular! The knights are not seeking our souls for God; they
are seeking our land for their own use. They have brought us to this,—that we must
either beg or be robbers if we are to save the lives in us. The knights are worse
than the Mongols. All that the land gives, or that bees gather in they take. They
do not let us kill a beast, or catch a fish, or trade with our neighbors. They take
our children as hostages, our elders they hunt off to Prussia and imprison; our sisters
and daughters they take for themselves. And still those men wear the cross of Christ
on their mantles! Have pity on us. We too are men, and not wild beasts. We would take
Christianity, and be baptized not in blood, but in sacred water.”
</p>
<p>When the knights did not cease visiting their “godchildren,” the latter greeted them
with these words: “What place will ye rob now, for everything is taken by your prelates
<span class="pageNum" id="pb333">[<a href="#pb333">333</a>]</span>and priests,—all wool, honey, and milk. They teach Christianity poorly.”
</p>
<p>The Grand Master, for the amusement of his guests, made an “excursion” to the island
of Pillene, where four thousand people of Jmud, men, women, and children, together
with their elders, had entrenched themselves strongly. In vain did the Germans fill
the ditches, attack and cut down people; they could not take the place. At last they
hurled in burning arrows wrapped with a blazing substance, and the fortress took fire
on all sides.
</p>
<p>The besieged resolved to perish. They built up a great pile of wood, and threw on
to it all that they held of most value. That done, they slew one another; fathers
killed their children, husbands their wives, and put the bodies on the pile. The few
who remained arranged themselves in pairs and stabbed one another; those who died
first were placed on the pile by those who died later. The elder of the people stood
apart and watched everything to the end. When all the others were dead he killed his
wife, put her on the pile, and set fire to it, then he mounted the blazing wood, killed
himself, and burned with his people. When the knights broke in they found no one to
finish, and had merely to tell in their annals of the dreadful tragedy in which they
had played the part both of actors and of audience.
</p>
<p>Gedimin declared entire liberty to the Orthodox Church, and before his countrymen
he announced himself a defender of that pagan faith to which they adhered so devotedly.
In Vilna the znitch (sacred fire) was maintained without dying, and every rite of
that interesting Lithuanian religion was supported in its primitive vigor. For this
he was denounced, and the Livonian Knights began war for that cross the symbol of
which, together with a sword, they wore embroidered on their mantles.
</p>
<p>Gedimin went out to meet them, and this was his last encounter with Germans. On the
right bank of the Niemen in that Jmud land was a strong fortress, Velona, a defense
against Germans, almost on the edge of that district which the Knights of the Cross
and Livonia had conquered. Thus far they had not been able to take Velona, and even
now they did not venture to storm it. They determined to destroy the stronghold in
another way. They built a fortress at each side of it, and set about starving out
the garrison.
</p>
<p>Gedimin came to the rescue of his people, and was soon besieging <span class="pageNum" id="pb334">[<a href="#pb334">334</a>]</span>the Germans in their two fortresses. Firearms had become known in the West only a
short time before, and the Germans were now using guns, which later on were called
“squealers.” During the conflict, Gedimin was killed by a ball. He was taken to Vilna
and seated on his favorite horse. By him were placed his faithful armor-bearer, his
hunting-dogs and falcons, and he and they were then burned according to the primitive
ritual of the Lithuanians. With him were burned three German knights in full armor,
and much booty taken from Germans.
</p>
<p>Gedimin had married twice, each time a Russian princess. Five of his sons were Orthodox
and belong entirely to Russian history. Of five daughters, four received Orthodox
baptism, and two—Maria, the widow of Dmitri of Tver, surnamed Terrible Eyes, and Augusta,
the first wife of Ivan <span class="corr" id="xd32e2846" title="Source: Kalita’s">Kalitá’s</span> son—died nuns. Gedimin left a domain extending from the Niemen to the Lower Dnieper
and the Dniester, including Kief, the ancient capital. This state, by special structure,
population and religion, was for the greater part Russian, especially in language.
</p>
<p>Of Gedimin’s sons who survived him, seven are mentioned. Of these the ablest and most
important was Olgerd, with whom his brother, Keistut, was associated closely. Olgerd’s
first wife was a daughter of the Vitebsk prince who left no sons, and through this
wife Olgerd inherited her father’s possessions. Soon after Gedimin’s death, Olgerd
seized power over all his brothers, took Vilna and became the one ruler of Lithuania.
This meant at that time Kief and the best part of Russia.
</p>
<p>Russian chronicles, without praising Olgerd, give him full justice. His self-restraint
was unparalleled. He refrained from vain things most carefully, from sports and amusements
of all kinds. He drank no wine, beer or mead. He was temperate in every way; from
this, he acquired clear reason and great keenness. His mind was ever working; he toiled
day and night at extending his dominion; he won many countries and lands; he subjected
cities with all the broad regions under them; he increased his possessions untiringly.
Olgerd was equally at home in Lithuania and Russia. He spoke with the Jmud men like
a neighbor; Russian was his language from <span class="corr" id="xd32e2853" title="Source: childood">childhood</span>. With the Knights of the Cross he could speak in German, and he knew something of
Latin.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb335">[<a href="#pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p>With Lithuanian princes love of war was inborn, but Olgerd surpassed all men in the
cunning of his sudden attacks, and the subtle concealment of his purpose. There was
no man more unsparing and ruthless than Olgerd. He warred with the Mongols near Kief,
and hunted them out of Podolia. He inflicted bloody defeat on the Germans near the
Niemen, while helping Lyubart, his brother. He drove the Poles from Volynia and Galitch,
and fought with them in their own places; he threatened also the Hungarians. Olgerd’s
sword was the most terrible ever wielded by a man of his dynasty; while defending
Polotsk from Livonia it defended Volynia and Kief from Polish inroads.
</p>
<p>But that which might satisfy Mindog or Gedimin could not satisfy Olgerd. To be prince
of Lithuania and one half of Russia was not his ambition; he was striving for more
than that, striving for power over Smolensk, Tver, Pskoff, Novgorod, and Moscow. He
aspired to be ruler of all Russia. The Moscow princes had in him a dangerous enemy.
Hence the Grand Prince of Moscow, in struggling to consolidate Russia, and put himself
at the head of it, had a problem of the utmost complication and difficulty.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h2 class="main">DIVISION OF THE MONGOL HORDE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Lithuania increased after Gedimin’s death, and so did Moscow when Ivan Kalitá was
succeeded by Simeon.
</p>
<p>After the death of Ivan, who died a few months before Uzbek, his sons Simeon, Ivan,
and Andrei went to Sarai. Other princes went hither also, among them Constantine,
son of Michael of Tver, and the Suzdal prince, Constantine, son of Vassili. Both the
Tver prince and the Suzdal prince hoped to obtain the first place through seniority.
Uzbek, now very old, received the three Moscow princes with kindness and sympathy.
Through friendship for their father, he preferred them to others, and gave Simeon
the patent immediately. He enjoined obedience to the Grand Khan, declared that he
would listen to no calumnies against them, and dismissed the three brothers with affection
and honor. Ivan’s heirs were all included in this grand patent. Uzbek engaged not
to take from those heirs the inheritance of their ancestors, to give the principality
to them, and not to others. After them it should go to their children. This distinction
exalted the Moscow house above others immediately, and raised Simeon, the oldest man
in it, supremely.
</p>
<p>Simeon, like his father, used the title Grand Prince of All Russia. This title, so
great in its meaning and future importance, received strength from the Moscow throne,
which had now become magnified. On returning from the Horde Simeon took his place
in Moscow as Grand Prince. While at the Horde he had met many Russian princes; he
met others in Vladimir, where, after he had received the metropolitan’s blessing,
he was solemnly greeted by all men. Later, there was a general assembling of princes
in Moscow, at Simeon’s invitation. “Esteemed and dear brethren,” said Simeon, addressing
the princes, “if there be peace and agreement <span class="pageNum" id="pb337">[<a href="#pb337">337</a>]</span>among us, Russia will be free again, as she was in the days of the earlier princes.”
</p>
<p>According to Simeon, there was power enough to defend Russia, but there was lack of
agreement. At that meeting he mentioned the offenses of Novgorod, complained of those
unjust, wayward people, and said, “They make war and peace with whomever they please,
consulting with no one. Novgorod regards not all Russia, and will not obey her Grand
Prince.” It was resolved then to punish and subdue Great Novgorod. War had been declared
by Ivan before his death, and Simeon had inherited this struggle.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Novgorod had added a new offense. Its daring freebooters, who were real
river and land pirates, had plundered Moscow possessions in the Ustyug and Bailozero
regions. To such an insolent challenge, Simeon replied with moderation. He sent men
to collect Torjok arrears of long established taxes, which, because of troubles in
Vladimir, Novgorod had neglected. At times these taxes were paid, at times they were
disputed. With the tax officials went now a small number of warriors. These men remained
in Torjok, and sent collectors to all appointed places. At this the Novgorod boyars
in Torjok sent to their city for aid. When the Novgorod party appeared, they imprisoned
Simeon’s lieutenant and his officials. Torjok envoys arrived at this time in Moscow
with haughty speeches.
</p>
<p>“How is this?” asked they of Simeon. “Thou art not confirmed yet in Novgorod, and
hast not taken thy seat in the city; still thy boyars are acting among us.” They pointed
out to Simeon that he was <i>gosudar</i> (lord) in Moscow alone; that Novgorod chose its own princes and would not endure
dictation. To sum up briefly, they multiplied those explanations because of which
Kalitá had recently declared war against Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Simeon did not argue; he mustered his forces. There was an outbreak and riot in Torjok,
where, as in Novgorod, common men took the part of the Grand Prince. They freed the
Moscow officials, and then fell to plundering the rich men of Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Simeon was rapidly approaching with his army. He was met with gladness by
the people of Torjok. With him came princes from Rostoff, Yaroslavl, and Suzdal. Novgorod
men, as ever, used lofty phrases at first, but eschewed hopeless <span class="pageNum" id="pb338">[<a href="#pb338">338</a>]</span>warfare, and sent to ask peace of the Grand Prince. They paid all dues past and present;
besides, it was settled that without the consent of the Grand Prince, the city would
not war against any one, or make an alliance.
</p>
<p>In general it may be said that during Simeon’s reign and that of his immediate successors
the affairs of Novgorod and Pskoff did not thrive very greatly. Meanwhile there was
continual conflict along Baltic waters, east, north and south of Riga. Every place
was in fear of being attacked on a sudden. Hostility from foreigners was the great,
the chronic evil. In Moscow, peace reigned almost as completely as in Kalitá’s day.
The same relations with the Horde that had been maintained during Uzbek’s reign were
maintained during the rule of Chanibek, who became Khan in 1340. The first threats
of danger came from the West, which was at this time an enemy far more dangerous to
Moscow than were the Mongols.
</p>
<p>When Olgerd took Vilna in 1345, and declared himself lord of Lithuania, certain brothers
of his sought an asylum in Moscow. Simeon had now to reckon on meeting Olgerd, whose
attack on Majaisk was still fresh in his memory, as well as his raid on Novgorod,
and his insolent deeds in Pskoff, which were followed by plundering Pskoff regions.
Roused to action by Olgerd’s fleeing brothers, Simeon was ready for conflict. Olgerd,
knowing this, planned to checkmate him. He sent a great embassy to Chanibek with rich
presents. At the head of this embassy went his own brother, Koriat, accompanied by
a number of princes. He asked for an alliance against their common enemies, chief
of whom, as he stated, was the Grand Prince of Moscow.
</p>
<p>Simeon learned of this move, and sent envoys immediately to Chanibek. Among them were
Russianized Mongol murzas, then serving the Moscow prince.
</p>
<p>By Lithuania they understood at the Horde, from Batu’s day, something quite different
and independent of that Russia subjected by Mongols. In Gedimin’s time, Lithuania
was not only independent, but dangerous, and dreaded by Uzbek. Hence the imploring
and lowly attitude of Lithuania pleased the Khan greatly, and the embassy was received
with distinction. But when Simeon’s envoys came, the position changed quickly. They
explained through the Russianized murzas that Olgerd, by his attacks and <span class="pageNum" id="pb339">[<a href="#pb339">339</a>]</span>incursions, was devastating the Khan’s dominions, and leading out prisoners in multitudes.
“If thou permit this,” said they, “Olgerd will take us all captive, and make thy dominions
a desert.”
</p>
<p>Chanibek was “as angry as fire.” He seized the Lithuanians and sent them to Moscow.
With them went, as special envoy, Tatuti, to deliver to the Grand Prince Koriat, Olgerd’s
brother, and all who were with him. Olgerd grew mild now, the more so since he had
suffered a crushing defeat from the Germans. Those iron-clad warriors had broken into
Lithuania, taken Troki, and ravaged the country around it. Olgerd had such a battle
with them as he had never known previously. Fourteen thousand Lithuanians fell. It
was no time to quarrel with Moscow, hence he sent an embassy to Simeon with many gifts
and a humble prayer for peace, the life of his brother, and the freedom of that brother’s
attendants.
</p>
<p>Simeon, who had recourse to war only when war was unavoidable, received Olgerd’s envoys
with favor, concluded peace with them, and freed Koriat with his embassy.
</p>
<p>Soon after this, Olgerd again became related to Simeon, whose first wife was a daughter
of Gedimin. Simeon in 1347 married Maria, the daughter of Alexander, son of Michael,
the Tver prince, who, with his father, was put to death by the Mongols. Olgerd asked
now for the hand of Julianna, Maria’s sister. Simeon, being the guardian of his sister-in-law,
was troubled about Olgerd’s Christianity. He had been baptized before taking Maria
of Vitebsk, his first wife, and had declared at Pskoff that he was a Christian, but
after Maria’s death he had persecuted Christians, in order to hold his heathen subjects
more firmly, and three Orthodox Christians had been martyred in Vilna. But after consulting
the metropolitan, Simeon gave Julianna in marriage to Olgerd.
</p>
<p>This marriage was memorable, for by this Julianna Olgerd had his son Yagello, the
first of the Yagello dynasty, the man who gave Lithuania to Latinism and to Poland.
</p>
<p>The house of Gedimin strengthened its relations with the house of Rurik by another
marriage, that of Lyubart, Olgerd’s brother. After the death of his first wife, the
great-granddaughter of Daniel of Galitch, Lyubart asked in marriage Simeon’s niece,
a daughter of Constantine, the Pskoff prince.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb340">[<a href="#pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Olgerd, though doubly a brother-in-law of the Moscow prince, became more intimate
with his wife’s brothers, Michael and Vsevolod, sons of Alexander the martyr. Soon
after this, Michael became the most prominent of all the Tver princes, and threatened
Moscow, through Olgerd, with attacks, which Olgerd, in the guise of assistance to
the Tver prince, never ceased to make while it was humanly possible to do so.
</p>
<p>While Michael’s sons were living, Constantine in Tver, and Vassili in Kashin, the
Tver princes bore themselves peaceably. Their quarrels were moderated somewhat by
Simeon, who gave his daughter in marriage to Michael, the son of Vassili. Simeon favored
Vassili because of his seniority, though he loved Vsevolod, who was quarreling with
Michael. But after Simeon’s death, the internal Tver quarrel broke out with violence.
</p>
<p>In Ryazan princely quarrels were endless, till Oleg rose there above other princes,
and for a time was important.
</p>
<p>During his short reign Simeon warred only with those who attacked him, against whom
he was forced to defend himself. The first of these was Olgerd, who, at the death
of Simeon’s father, had attacked Mojaisk. In company with the Smolensk prince, Olgerd
also attacked Novgorod savagely. But these wars were stopped before they became very
serious.
</p>
<p>After Olgerd’s second marriage he did not desist from those seizures. When he had
connected many towns of Smolensk with his rule, and annexed some of them, he strove
to extend his dominion to places claimed both by Moscow and Tver, and also to places
south of Smolensk and Kaluga.
</p>
<p>In 1351–1352 Simeon was forced to take arms because of this action. He declared war
on Olgerd, and marched with strong forces against him. Olgerd preferred to negotiate.
He sent envoys with gifts, and Simeon inclined to peace. Certain towns acknowledged
by Olgerd as belonging to Moscow were claimed by Smolensk. Simeon then led forward
his forces, and took possession of them. In this way the war ended favorably for Moscow,
and was the last act of Simeon’s life. He died of the plague April 27, 1352. Forty
days earlier, Feognost, the metropolitan of Russia, had died of old age. That same
week Simeon lost two young sons, and almost at the same time Andrei, his brother.
Of Kalitá’s sons there now remained only one, Ivan, the successor of Simeon.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb341">[<a href="#pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before touching on the reign of Ivan, it is well to give some account of the man who
succeeded Feognost as metropolitan, namely, Alexis. In the time of Nevski’s youngest
son, Daniel, the boyar, Feodor Byakont, came to Moscow from Chernigoff, and was looked
on with favor by Daniel. When Feodor’s first son was christened, Ivan, son of Daniel,
then eight years of age, became his sponsor. The child was named Yelevtheri. He grew
up, so to speak, in the palace, for he was a favorite in the family of Prince Daniel.
They reared him carefully to serve the prince, but from childhood he was drawn in
another direction. While still a youth he became a monk, and was distinguished among
all monks in Moscow for love of letters, and zeal in everything with which he was
entrusted.
</p>
<p>Feognost noted Yelevtheri, and tried him in various ways. The young monk learned Greek
sufficiently well to gain familiarity with the ancient classics, and compare the Slav
testament with the original. There remains to this day a copy of the Gospels, which
is not only his translation, but is in his handwriting. When Yelevtheri, now called
Alexis, reached the office of abbot, Feognost, who was absent frequently, made him
assistant, and finally vicar. Later he was bishop in Vladimir, and there he was when
Feognost passed away from his labors. Feognost had wished Alexis to be his successor
if possible.
</p>
<p>It had been the fixed habit of the Patriarchs to appoint Greeks to the office of metropolitan.
On the eve of Feognost’s death he sent his last letter to Tsargrad. In this letter
he asked with insistence that Alexis succeed him. He explained that it would harm
the Empire if another were chosen, and no matter whom they might send, the Grand Prince
would not receive him.
</p>
<p>For his zeal Feognost, though a Greek, was beloved in Russia, since he understood
the true interests of the country. When he came to Russia in that gloomy day of the
Mongol domination, it depended greatly on him to keep the seat of his office in Moscow.
Selected by Peter, his predecessor, he did not forget Peter’s blessing to the city,
and he made it his residence.
</p>
<p>Tenibek and Chanibek, Uzbek’s successors at the Horde, were not tolerant like their
father. They had a Mohammedan hatred of Christians, and wished to tax Christianity.
The metropolitan stood firm against this, though threatened with torture, and he <span class="pageNum" id="pb342">[<a href="#pb342">342</a>]</span>succeeded in preserving ecclesiastical freedom. Among his many services one of the
greatest was his choice of a successor, whose services to the Church of Russia at
that time were beyond estimate.
</p>
<p>Simeon, the Grand Prince of Moscow, was succeeded by Ivan, his brother. Constantine
of Suzdal, assisted by Novgorod, strove in vain to obtain the Grand Principality.
Though Novgorod sent great gifts to the Horde, we may be sure that the Moscow gifts
were not of less value. This Ivan, called the Mild, who, according to contemporary
opinion, looked on the honor and glory of this world as nothing, and was considered
notably good by his people, later historians speak of as being weak, though facts
do not bear out this estimate. The difficulties of his time rose from circumstances,
and not from Ivan’s lack of ability. In fact his patience was perhaps the best weapon
that could have been used. The evils not being serious, dropped away of themselves,
and Ivan left to his successor a principality strengthened by peace, and not weakened
by struggles.
</p>
<p>The first trouble of his reign was an attack from Ryazan. Oleg, the new prince there,
seized Lopasnya. A Moscow boyar, Ivan’s lieutenant, was imprisoned, and was freed
only after a heavy ransom had been paid. Oleg, not hoping to keep the place without
the Khan’s sanction, took means to obtain it.
</p>
<p>Five years later Mamat Hodja informed Ivan that he had been appointed by the Khan
to establish an exact boundary between Ryazan and Moscow. The Moscow prince, knowing
that this was a move directed against him, refused to let Mamat enter Moscow territory,
and sent word to him that his boundaries were known to himself and undoubted. Mamat
could accomplish nothing; so he started to return to the Horde. On the road he quarreled
with one of the Khan’s favorites and killed him. He fled to the mouth of the Don,
but quick pursuers overtook him, and he was slain at command of the Khan. Thus the
places seized by Oleg were not yielded by Moscow.
</p>
<p>More serious than Oleg’s attempt to change the boundaries, which remained without
result, were the efforts of the Suzdal prince, Constantine, who, assisted by Novgorod,
strove to win the Grand Principality. Failing in this, he still did not make peace
with Moscow, neither did Novgorod, which withheld Mongol tribute, and expelled Moscow
lieutenants.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb343">[<a href="#pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not succeeding at the Horde, Constantine withdrew to Nizni-Novgorod, where he built
a stone church to the Saviour, and strengthened the Kremlin. Boris, his son, he married
to a daughter of Olgerd: he made friends with Lithuania; kept up with Novgorod relations
hostile to Moscow, and bore himself haughtily at all times.
</p>
<p>Olgerd attacked now most actively. His plan was to master all Russia, as he had mastered
Polotsk, Kief, and Vilna. While at war with Smolensk he captured the heir to that
place and detained him. In regions touching Kaluga and Tula, such as Obolensk, Novasil,
and Odoeff he seated his lieutenants as in Grodno or Vitebsk. In regions where his
plans had been balked by Simeon of Moscow, he made himself master in Ivan’s time.
In all places he injured the Moscow prince, set aside his authority, and extended
his own power; in one place by dominion, in another by influence. In Tver, in Nizni-Novgorod,
even in Ryazan, he had adherents. In Tsargrad itself he met no refusal. At his request,
and through gifts, a second metropolitan, named Roman, was appointed for Russia.
</p>
<p>Olgerd considered as his own not only all parts of Western and Southern Russia, but
also those regions which were under the Khan; caring little that the Mongol was its
master. Nay, he used this fact as reason for extending dominion, since the shield
of Lithuania promised freedom from the Mongol. Olgerd looked on the Tver principality
as half conquered. In Tver at this time, the reduced princes, descendants of Constantine
and Vassili, the younger sons of Michael the Martyr, were on the verge of political
extinction.
</p>
<p>Alexander, Michael’s second son, had become the eldest of the line, through the death
of Michael’s brother Dmitri Terrible-Eyes, who died childless. The chief power of
this prince and his brothers came from Olgerd, whose wife was Julianna, their sister,
the mother of Yagello, It is clear that at this time Olgerd’s influence in Tver was
very great. The descendants of Constantine and Vassili, who had become poor and were
quarreling continually, sought the assistance of Moscow, while Olgerd’s brothers-in-law
turned from Moscow and were growing hostile to Ivan.
</p>
<p>Tver began to recognize Roman, Olgerd’s metropolitan. Novgorod also, through enmity
to Moscow, preferred Roman. Even <span class="pageNum" id="pb344">[<a href="#pb344">344</a>]</span>Boris, Olgerd’s new son-in-law, refused somewhat later in Nizni to communicate with
Moscow in church matters, and turned to Lithuania. But if in places like those just
mentioned, subject only to Olgerd’s remote influence, there was such opposition to
the Moscow metropolitan of Kief and all Russia, in places half subject to Olgerd,—and
there were many such,—if people wished to recognize him, the civil power stopped them
when possible. In places where Olgerd had real power, Roman, the metropolitan whom
he had created, was declared metropolitan of Kief and all Russia.
</p>
<p>Olgerd’s design was to unite Russia, both spiritually and temporally. To do this he
must eliminate the metropolitan of Moscow, and bring all princes under his own dominion.
At this time, too, the Horde sternly demanded fresh tribute. This was the situation
which confronted Ivan the Mild. It was not created by him, and was not the result
of his qualities. It may be that Olgerd’s daring was roused and strengthened by Ivan’s
mildness, but in the end Lithuania gained nothing by it. The ill-will between Novgorod
and Moscow ended easily. Novgorod continued its opposition for a year and a half,
but no evil to Moscow resulted from it.
</p>
<p>After Prince Constantine had strengthened Nizni-Novgorod, and built a stone church
there, no warriors came from Moscow to threaten him, but that was not through any
weakness in Moscow. Ivan did not hide his displeasure at Novgorod for supporting Constantine
at the Horde, and withholding the tribute. Novgorod complained against the Moscow
metropolitan at Tsargrad, and had relations with Olgerd. Ivan was well aware of this.
It was known that he was preparing to chastise Novgorod, and that many of the other
princes were ready to march with him. Constantine, not daring to disobey an order
from the Khan to make peace with the Grand Prince, sent envoys to Moscow. Those envoys
were joined by others from Novgorod. Thus Ivan, without warring, won peace at last
from all opponents, Novgorod paid the tribute, and received the tax officials who
had been appointed by Moscow in Simeon’s time.
</p>
<p>In the popular mind there was later a wonderful tradition concerning the days of Ivan
the Mild; that serious and even dreadful period when all feared destruction. There
had been demands for fresh tribute, and there were ominous reports from the Horde,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb345">[<a href="#pb345">345</a>]</span>when, as the tale runs, this message came to the Grand Prince: “Send thy chief priest
(the metropolitan) to us quickly. We hear that God listens to his prayers always.
Let him cure our Tsaritsa.” The metropolitan answered: “That is beyond my measure.”
Encouraged, however, by the Grand Prince, and trusting in God, he went to the Horde
and found that Taidula, the Khan’s wife, was blind, in addition to other ailings.
He declared that he was not a physician of the body, but that whoso asks with faith
him God will not despise, and he prayed over the sick woman. She was cured and there
was great rejoicing at the Horde. Taidula made the metropolitan a present of much
value, a ring with her seal on it. By putting this seal to papers, he could give them
the power of the Khan’s patent. Such was the faith in Alexis. But he hurried from
the Horde, for trouble came quickly. Taidula’s husband was no longer Khan, but her
son Berdibek, who had seized the place of his father, Chanibek. Chanibek had been
able to keep together for a short time the inheritance of Uzbek, his father, by killing
his two brothers. He had ruled the Horde in the old way and extended his power from
the Volga to the Aral, and beyond the river Terek to Persia. Terrible to his Mohammedan
subjects, he was kind to Russian Christians. He reigned, however, only eighteen years.
</p>
<p>Not long before Chanibek’s death, there rose in the Horde a strong personage, Tavlug
Bey, who disliked Chanibek and did not cease to whisper to Berdibek, the Khan’s son:
“It is time for thee to sit on the throne. It is time for thy father to leave it.”
Through various devices he was able to bring the Horde magnates to that way of thinking.
When in 1358 his perfidious advice was accepted, Chanibek died by strangulation.
</p>
<p>Berdibek’s accession forced the princes to go to the Horde for fresh confirmation.
On gaining power the new Khan killed all his brothers—there were twelve of them. There
was now great trouble in Russia, a new demand was made for tribute. From Moscow came
a request for Alexis the metropolitan to go to the Horde and soothe Berdibek’s anger.
So he hastened back, and was there probably when Berdibek’s brothers were murdered.
It is undoubted that the metropolitan was able to influence Berdibek, and save the
Russian Church from taxation.
</p>
<p>Ivan the Mild died November, 1359, at the age of thirty-three, <span class="pageNum" id="pb346">[<a href="#pb346">346</a>]</span>after a reign of six years. Now too died Berdibek, who had ruled a little more than
a year. Then evil gave birth to new evil, one conspiracy succeeded another, parricide
was followed by fratricide; one Khan took the place of another on a blood-reeking
throne, and over each one the chronicler utter these words: “He received the reward
of his actions.”
</p>
<p>Berdibek was followed by Kulpa, who ruled six months and five days, then “the judgment
of God did not suffer him longer.” He and his two sons were assassinated by Nurus,
but not long could Nurus hold the throne, for Hidjrbek of the Blue Horde on the Yaik
intrigued against him. He was given up to Hidjrbek, and he and his sons were murdered.
Hidjrbek was murdered by his son, Timur Khoja, in 1361. One month and seven days later
Timur Khoja was slain in a revolution effected unexpectedly by a new man, Mamai. This
Mamai surpassed in a short time all others to such a degree that the bloody revolution
made by him put an end to uprisings.
</p>
<p>Mamai’s adherents, who were in the Don region, separated from those of Sarai on the
Volga, and rose against Timur Khoja. This parricide feared death in Sarai, and fled
from the left to the right bank of the Volga, where he perished most wretchedly.
</p>
<p>Mamai placed now in his own Horde a new Khan, Abdul; but the Sarai men proclaimed
Hidjrbek’s brother, Murad; thus the original Volga Horde became divided, and the seeds
of destruction were sown. About that time Kildybek, who declared himself to be Chanibek’s
son, and a grandson of Uzbek, began war as a third Khan, and killed many prisoners,
after which he himself was killed. Khan Murad now made an effort to unite the two
Hordes. He attacked Mamai, and slew many warriors, but did not succeed in his purpose.
There were now two Khans, Abdul was made Khan by Mamai on the right bank of the Volga,
and Murad was Khan on the east of that river, “and those two Khans were in enmity
always.”
</p>
<p>The division of the Horde brought great unrest and disturbance in Russia, not because
Prince Dmitri, the heir to the Grand Principality, was a boy, but because at the Horde
there was no one in permanent possession. Though the Moscow boyars had sent an envoy,
they did not decide that Dmitri should go to either rival. This delay gave the Suzdal
princes some advantage. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb347">[<a href="#pb347">347</a>]</span>Moscow men, hearing of Hidjrbek’s accession, took their Dmitri, who was nine years
of age, to the Horde at Sarai and presented him to the Khan. But their journey was
not successful. Troubles increased at the Horde. There was no time for talking with
Hidjrbek. The great point was to escape at the earliest moment.
</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the turmoil of Sarai, Dmitri, son of Constantine, the late Suzdal
ruler and prince in Nizni-Novgorod, settled in Vladimir, and declared himself Grand
Prince, trying thus to restore to Vladimir its old-time prestige and position as capital.
This namesake of Dmitri of Moscow, and some years later his father-in-law, had been
advised by Andrei, his elder brother, to avoid the Grand Principality. “The Khan wants
gifts,” said Andrei. “Dmitri of Moscow is the natural heir, and will get his own a
little later.” But Dmitri of Suzdal would not wait; he gave immense gifts to the Horde,
and got the patent. By this time many of the Russian princes had become accustomed
to the idea that the Grand Principality belonged to the Moscow princes. Novgorod men,
however, were well satisfied with the son of Constantine, Moscow’s opponent, but no
other people were pleased with him; even in Tver they preferred the Moscow prince,
and no later than 1362 Dmitri of Moscow received the patent.
</p>
<p>The Horde was so divided, that no one knew whom to obey. In Sarai, east of the Volga,
was Murad, and west, on the Don side, was Abdul. Moscow preferred Murad because he
held Sarai, the old capital. But as this Khan gave no troops, the Suzdal prince would
neither obey nor abandon Vladimir. The Moscow boyars then put Dmitri on horseback,
and also his brother and cousin, both young boys, and set out with great forces to
expel the son of Constantine, who fled from Vladimir to Suzdal. His brother, Andrei,
now reproached him a second time: “Have I not told thee never to trust Mongols? Why
not listen to me? Thou seest that it is easy to lose what is thine while striving
to take what belongs to another.” And he advised friendship with Moscow, “that Christianity
might not perish.” For in Moscow men began now to see the first hope of liberation
from the Mongol. The two brothers divided their inheritance. Andrei took Nizni; to
Dmitri fell Suzdal.
</p>
<p>Dmitri of Moscow entered Vladimir and took his seat on the throne there. That done,
he returned to Moscow. So Kalitá’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb348">[<a href="#pb348">348</a>]</span>grandson made certain the purpose of his grandfather. He made that inheritance of
his family secure, and began the great work, the real mission of Russia.
</p>
<p>It was given to the Russian people as a task from the first to stand unbroken between
Europe and Asia, to stand apart and independent of both. From the time that the name
Rus first appeared the country had its own individuality, and was self-determining.
From of old two warring principles attacked her, one from the West, the other from
the East. This gave the great problem to Russian history. Russia was to give way neither
to Europe, nor Asia; she was to fathom and understand both of them, but be subject
to neither. This, too, was the position of the whole Slav race, a position which tortured
and tore it, till some parts were conquered and absorbed by strange nations, so that
on the west they were turned into Germans, Magyars and Italians, while on the south
they were turned into Mussulman.
</p>
<p>This old and difficult problem had to be met in all its weight and its terrible bitterness
by the Moscow principality. To meet it, struggle with it, and solve it successfully
required an enormous waste of force, a continuous and endless persistence. If Moscow
had not grown sufficiently strong at the right time there would have been no Russia
at present. For on the one side there would not have been strength enough to emerge
from Mongol slavery, while on the other side, if there had not been the moral and
physical power to face Western Europe, Russia would have been absorbed, would have
taken another form, would have been an element in the strength of her enemy. On the
east, Moscow was forced to defend herself, weapons in hand, or yield to the Mongol
forever. She had either to rise up in desperate war, or be voiceless and obedient.
On the west, a still more dangerous power was threatening, a power which might be
permanent and inexorable.
</p>
<p>This was the position of the Moscow principality when Dmitri, grandson of Kalitá,
began rule in Moscow. Though the struggle on the east and the west was contemporary,
the great battle was first begun with the Mongol.
</p>
<p>Abdul, the Khan on the right bank of the Volga, became jealous upon learning that
Dmitri had received his patent from Murad, and immediately sent a patent from himself
with a gracious embassy, though no one had asked him to do so. The Moscow <span class="pageNum" id="pb349">[<a href="#pb349">349</a>]</span>boyars met these men courteously, and gave them good presents at parting. But when
Murad of Sarai heard that a patent had gone from Abdul to Dmitri, he was greatly enraged
against Moscow, and, to spite Abdul, he made Dmitri of Suzdal Grand Prince a second
time.
</p>
<p>There was in Sarai at this juncture one of the reduced Bailozero princes; with this
prince, and very likely other adherents of the Suzdal prince, a Mongol embassy numbering
thirty persons arrived in Suzdal to declare the Khan’s will. They had no warriors
with them, still Dmitri of Suzdal was delighted with the Khan’s favor, and again took
his seat in Vladimir.
</p>
<p>Moscow could not forgive this. Dmitri of Moscow marched with a great force, and not
only hunted Dmitri out of Vladimir and Suzdal with shame, but ravaged Suzdal. The
Suzdal prince, thus humiliated, had recourse to Andrei, who was ruling quietly in
Nizni, and had often warned his foolish brother against rivalry with Moscow. Owing
to Andrei’s intercession, the Moscow prince left Dmitri in Suzdal, but reduced him
to thorough subjection, and deprived some of his allies of dominion.
</p>
<p>In 1363, when Moscow took final possession of Bailozero and Galiten beyond the Volga,
the Starodub prince lost his possessions; his province was added to Moscow. The Grand
Prince then extended his rule over the entire Rostoff region; some of the princes
were left, but left as assistants of Moscow. Dmitri of Suzdal became now a firm ally
of the Grand Prince. Thus the very first year of Dmitri’s reign was successful. It
was distinguished by the strengthening of his primacy, and by considerable accretions.
The two succeeding years were made calamitous for Moscow and all Russia by a second
appearance of the “black death.” A multitude of people died, and among them were many
princes. In Novgorod died Prince Andrei, so friendly to Moscow, and his brother, Dmitri
of Suzdal, became by inheritance prince in Nizni, but Olgerd’s son-in-law, Boris,
the youngest son of Constantine, seized Nizni before Dmitri, and would not yield.
Dmitri turned then to Moscow, and the Grand Prince assisted him. At this time the
Suzdal prince showed obedience to Moscow willingly. His eldest son, Vassili, who afterward
lost all his possessions, and is known in history as Kirdyapa, was at the Sarai Horde
just then, and secured a patent for his father, but his father refused it, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb350">[<a href="#pb350">350</a>]</span>informed the Grand Prince that he preferred his friendship to the favor of the Mongols.
</p>
<p>At the Horde, meanwhile, Boris, the younger brother, obtained the Nizni patent. In
view of this complication, an unusual decision was taken in Moscow. As on a time the
metropolitan, Peter, had forbidden the Terrible-Eyed Dmitri to lead his warriors against
Nizni, where the prince should be subordinate to Yuri of Moscow, so now, in the dispute
about Nizni, the metropolitan was active a second time.
</p>
<p>As Nizni was merely an adjunct of Suzdal, Nizni and Gorodets were subjected to Alexis,
the Suzdal bishop. The metropolitan separated the Novgorod district from the Suzdal
diocese, and declared it as belonging to the metropolitan directly. But Boris communicated
with Olgerd, his father-in-law, and, having well-wishers in Tver, showed resistance
to the metropolitan, and would not yield Nizni to his elder brother. In view of this
disobedience, the metropolitan summoned Sergius of Radonej, the abbot of the Troitsa
monastery, and sent him to declare to Boris that he must go with Dmitri and his brother
to have their dispute adjudged by the Grand Prince of Moscow.
</p>
<p>The mild Sergius, who obeyed the command sorrowfully, was forced to bear another burden
also: in case Boris would not obey he was to close the Nizni churches. The mildness
of Sergius, his continual avoidance of quarrels and disturbance, frequent in his day,
was well known, and if he did not refuse these difficult tasks it was clear to all
that the disobedience of Boris was beyond measure.
</p>
<p>Boris was unbending. He would not go to Moscow; he would not yield to his brother.
So troops were moved from Moscow against him; and because he refused to obey the Church
order the churches in Nizni were closed to all people. Dmitri, his brother, at the
head of troops sent from Moscow and his own troops, approached Nizni in great force.
But the affair did not come to blows. Boris came out to meet his brother, repented,
and was forgiven. The Grand Prince did not take all from him; he left Gorodets, and
took Nizni, joining it again to Suzdal. Soon after this the Nizni See was restored
to the Suzdal bishop.
</p>
<p>Boris lived peacefully afterward, a faithful subordinate to his brother, and to Suzdal.
The Nizni prince remained friendly to Dmitri of Moscow, who shortly after married
Yevdokiya, daughter <span class="pageNum" id="pb351">[<a href="#pb351">351</a>]</span>of the Nizni prince. Through respect for his future father-in-law, Dmitri did not
wish to invite the bride to Moscow for the wedding, and as Grand Prince of all Russia
he did not care to visit Suzdal, hence the ceremony took place in Kolomna, with all
the rich display of that time. The country rejoiced greatly at this marriage, which
strengthened the union of Nizni and Suzdal with Moscow.
</p>
<p>But barely had Moscow won agreement with Suzdal and the principalities attached to
it, when a long and stubborn struggle began with Tver, which at that time had come
to an alliance with Olgerd.
</p>
<p>During Dmitri’s reign Moscow had no such inveterate foe as was Olgerd, except, perhaps,
Mamai the Mongol. And Olgerd, in his struggle with Moscow, had a devoted assistant
in Tver, where reigned Michael, brother of Julianna, whose son, Yagello, was Olgerd’s
favorite offspring. After countless blood-spilling struggles with each other for possession
of petty districts, during which two towns, Tver and Kashin, were subjected to ruin
repeatedly, and after the plague, which brought death to many thousands of people,
there remained two rivals for the headship of Tver. The first was the only surviving
son of the martyr, Michael, Vassili, then an old man; the second was Michael, a grandson
of the martyr, and son of the ill-fated Alexander. This Michael was born in Pskoff,
as we remember, where the Bishop of Novgorod was his godfather; through his sister,
Julianna, he was brother-in-law of Olgerd. At first the small town of Mikulin was
Michael’s single possession, and for a long time he was called Mikulinski. But he
had now become strong through places left to him by his brothers. He had also received
by will from Simeon, his cousin, the town of Dórogobuj, with its dependencies. This
he received to the detriment of Vassili, his uncle, and Yeremi, Simeon’s own brother.
This cousin and uncle turned now to Moscow for redress, and Dórogobuj became the cause
of great trouble.
</p>
<p>Kalitá and his successors had been more inclined to Constantine and Vassili, the younger
sons of Michael the Martyr. Both elder sons, the Terrible-Eyed Dmitri and Alexander,
had been always incurably hostile to Moscow. Terrible-Eyes left no children, but the
sons of Alexander had inherited the pride of their father, and his hatred of Moscow.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb352">[<a href="#pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>Michael, on becoming Prince of Tver, found no quarrels between the two principalities.
Dórogobuj caused the first trouble. Vassili was prince in Kashin; he had been prince
in Tver after the death of his elder brother, Constantine, but was forced to yield
that place to Michael, his nephew. When he, with another nephew, Yeremi, turned to
Moscow for justice against Michael, the question was left to Alexis the metropolitan,
who deputed Vassili, the Tver bishop, to settle it. But Vassili’s decision brought
hostility instead of peace. Resting on the fact that Michael had taken Dórogobuj not
by force, but by the will of the late prince, the bishop recognized it as Michael’s
lawful property, and decided against Yeremi and Vassili.
</p>
<p>The baffled heirs took advantage of Michael’s visit to Lithuania, and made a new complaint
in Moscow. They demanded that the bishop be called to account for judging unjustly.
The inheritance, they said, did not belong to Simeon in such fashion that he could
dispose of it absolutely. Only a portion belonged to him, and that portion, besides,
was connected with conditions. Simeon’s uncle and his brother, Yeremi, claimed their
rights with insistence. The bishop was summoned to Moscow, where it was settled that
his decision was irregular, and he was forced to pay damages to the princes. Troops
were then given to instate Yeremi and Vassili in that part of the property adjudged
to them. But instead of peacefully taking possession of this property, they moved
against Tver and demanded a ransom. They got no ransom, and could not take Tver, hence
they plundered the country about it unmercifully. Michael, the Tver prince, returned
from Lithuania with assistance from Olgerd, and marched directly on Kashin, where
he seized the wives of the two princes with their relatives and many boyars. Vassili
and Yeremi begged for peace, which was granted, and all, including Michael, treated
with Dmitri of Moscow concerning it. But a year later, 1367, Yeremi set aside his
oath to Michael of Tver, and went to Moscow. The princes complained that Michael oppressed
and deceived them. The introduction of a Lithuanian force, and the crushing of the
Kashin prince, an adherent of Moscow, but most of all, perhaps, the active and unbending
pride of Prince Michael, were displeasing to the Grand Prince of Moscow. Though the
Tver prince had discussed peace in company with Yeremi and Vassili, he had attacked
Kashin, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb353">[<a href="#pb353">353</a>]</span>thus belittled the allies of Moscow, forgetting that those allies had Moscow troops
at their command.
</p>
<p>Moscow might have answered with war, but another course was thought better. It seemed
well to connect with this settlement all the Tver princes, and in giving a part of
the inheritance to Michael to let him have as much as Simeon had a right to bequeath,
and give the remainder to Yeremi and Vassili, who had struggled so stubbornly for
their rights. Moreover, by thus doing justice, Moscow would somewhat weaken the Tver
prince, which was the real point of the question. The complainants being allies, or
rather subordinates of Moscow, Michael of Tver did not oppose this division, and agreed
to visit Moscow. The Grand Prince invited him, and the metropolitan declared that
they awaited him in peace and good-will for a general discussion.
</p>
<p>Michael, then thirty years old, went to visit Dmitri, who was only eighteen, but he
found in Moscow what he had not expected. Having brought his most notable boyars,
he thought to see the principal Moscow boyars, and present his own in Dmitri’s capital.
They received him, however, not as a relative, but with haughtiness. He had thought
to astonish Moscow by readiness to yield a part of his own to the other two princes,
but this was considered in Moscow as decided long before, and they let him feel that
that was not the main question. They wanted him to show subjection to Moscow. Michael
flushed up with rage, and did not hesitate to tell Dmitri before all his boyars that
the rights of hospitality had been violated. After that was said, Moscow violated
those rights in reality.
</p>
<p>The men who had gone to Moscow with Michael were taken from him, and treated as if
in detention. Michael himself was lodged in a separate house, or palace, as if in
imprisonment. Such a turn of affairs was almost more grievous for Dmitri than for
Michael, and it grieved most of all the metropolitan, for the Tver prince put the
blame of the act on him. That passionate prince was indignant at the metropolitan:
“I believed his words, and came hither to Moscow,” said Michael; “now see what they
have done to me.” Michael considered it all planned previously through policy and
cunning. Both sides were equally vehement, each side declared itself right, and each
felt offended. There seemed no way to reconcile them. To hasten Michael’s release
<span class="pageNum" id="pb354">[<a href="#pb354">354</a>]</span>would be to declare that Dmitri had been the offender; his boyars would not agree
to this; they had brought about the detention and they insisted that it should continue.
</p>
<p>Dmitri now asked the metropolitan’s aid with all seriousness. Unexpectedly, at this
juncture, Mongol envoys came to deliver a reprimand to Dmitri. He had not paid the
tribute and had not shown himself to his master.
</p>
<p>The Tver question must be settled immediately. Michael was freed with fair promptness,
and if there was some delay, it was to avoid the appearance of over haste, and preserve
proprieties. The land which Michael had offered, namely Gorodok, was accepted for
Yeremi, and an oath paper was taken from Michael that he was satisfied, and had no
claim against any one. This done, he departed. After that Dmitri gave troops to instate
Yeremi in Gorodok.
</p>
<p>During this year, 1368, Prince Vassili died in Kashin, and Michael, by the death of
his uncle, became Prince of Tver in the fullest sense possible. He was now the eldest
of the house, and besides, the Tver people were satisfied with him. The angry enemy
of Moscow was strengthened. The position was still more entangled by the fact that
the heir of the late Prince Vassili, also Michael, now Prince of Kashin, and married
to Vassilissa, a daughter of Simeon the Proud, hastened in his turn to Moscow with
petitions. In Moscow, opposition from Michael was expected, and even an attack upon
Moscow regions was looked for. But the storm struck unexpectedly from elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Late in the autumn of 1368, Olgerd suddenly, as was his wont in such cases, attacked
Moscow regions without declaring hostilities. With him came Keistut, his brother,
and Vitold, his nephew, the latter still young and “not famous,” as the chronicler
tells us. They led in large forces. Moscow learned of this war only when the enemy
was capturing towns on the border. Moscow allies were summoned quickly, but only inconsiderable
regiments had time to muster. The invading force crushed all before it. Now there
was reason to be thankful for the stone walls recently built in Moscow; Dmitri had
all places cleared round the Kremlin, and every house burned which was near that firm
stronghold.
</p>
<p>The Lithuanian army stood three days outside those new walls. Olgerd had not power
to meet or crush them, but he did great <span class="pageNum" id="pb355">[<a href="#pb355">355</a>]</span>harm to Moscow in many parts. He burned nearly everything in the city and in the country
round, and took a multitude of captives. Then, driving along every beast which he
could find, he hastened homeward, for news had come to him that the Germans had attacked
his lands. He could say, however, that he had satisfied the tearful prayers of the
Tver prince, his brother-in-law, Michael. Surely Moscow would remember him, for he
had done as much harm as possible, and Michael was avenged.
</p>
<p>Dmitri ceased to defend Yeremi, from whom Gorodok was now taken, and Yeremi went to
Tver to seek favor from Michael. It seems that besides aid from Olgerd, the Tver prince
had sought to gain strength from the Mongols by rich gifts to the Khan, and to others.
At the Horde, anger was increasing against Dmitri. Mamai, now all-powerful, had eliminated
every opponent, and had effected that for which he had been struggling, the reunion
of the Horde. He had instated Mamant, a new Khan, and was now ready for action.
</p>
<p>A storm was rising against Moscow. Peace between Tver and Moscow was short-lived.
In 1370 war broke out again. Michael, the new Prince of Kashin, turned to Dmitri a
second time for protection. Dmitri informed Michael of Tver that he set aside his
oath papers; and the Tver prince immediately sought aid of Olgerd. This war with Tver,
or more correctly with Olgerd, lasted five years, counting intervals. If at times
Olgerd sought peace, even permanent peace, no one had faith in him, suspecting it
to be a plot to deceive Moscow. In view of this, only short truces were given, and
with caution. Through Lithuanian activity at the Horde, and through presents to the
Khan, the Mongols aided the Tver prince.
</p>
<p>The war ended only when Dmitri and all the princes who acknowledged him rose against
Olgerd and the Mongols, and brought Tver to conditions. Early in September, 1370,
Moscow troops, led by Dmitri, marched against Michael. They moved from Voloko-Lamsk
directly on Zubtsoff, a city which with Rjeff, its neighbor, had passed more than
once into Olgerd’s possession, thanks to Tver men. This time the Moscow troops did
not treat it with tenderness; they stormed, sacked, and destroyed the place. Then,
taking everyone captive, they marched to Mikulin, which stood on the road between
Moscow and Novgorod. This was <span class="pageNum" id="pb356">[<a href="#pb356">356</a>]</span>Michael’s own personal inheritance, hence no mercy was shown it. The native nest of
Alexander’s descendants was given to destruction. The troops took it by storm, and
then razed it to the ground.
</p>
<p>After taking Mikulin, they made the whole region around it empty. They captured the
people, and seized all their cattle. Cattle were the main wealth of Russia at that
time, hence at the end of hostilities it was often stipulated in treaties that the
cattle should be returned. The Grand Prince went back to Moscow with great herds,
and filled his land with cattle. He had avenged Olgerd’s insult, and humiliated the
Tver men most effectively.
</p>
<p>When Michael, who was in Lithuania, heard of the ruin of his birthplace, his sister
assured him that Olgerd would send him aid when he returned from warring with the
Germans. Michael at the same time was in active communication with the Horde. He had
sent gifts of such value to the Mongols, and had won Mamai’s confidence so thoroughly,
that in Moscow they soon received most astonishing news, though hardly anything could
astonish in those days,—news which made Dmitri indignant.
</p>
<p>Mamai had placed Michael of Tver in Vladimir as Grand Prince. Sari Hodja had already
invited the Tver prince to come to the Horde for the patent. Dmitri immediately placed
guards on all roads, and sent mounted men everywhere to seize Michael should he go
for the patent. But Michael, rejoicing at Olgerd’s return from warring successfully
with the Germans, deferred the Horde visit. Olgerd promised to strike the Kremlin
with his spear-points, and give a lesson to Dmitri. “The true warrior makes no delay,”
remarked Olgerd; “his plan being made, he strikes quickly. Dmitri threatens to take
Kief, Polotsk and Vitebsk from me; through fire and sword he wants to say, in Vilna,
‘Christ has arisen.’ He need not come so far. We will break the fast in Moscow. Dmitri
will be at Easter mass in the Moscow cathedral; we will give a red egg to the prince
on that morning.”
</p>
<p>The campaign of Tver and Lithuania against Moscow was decided. This time, too, Olgerd’s
attack was distinguished for suddenness and fury. He had not such success as the first
time, however. Starting with a strong army toward the end of November, he was at Moscow
on December 6. He was aided by Michael of Tver, by his brother, and by the Smolensk
prince, their ally. A number of thousands of peasants with axes cut a road through
<span class="pageNum" id="pb357">[<a href="#pb357">357</a>]</span>dense forests, and laid logs in morasses. The troops marched without rest; they hardly
halted day or night. When he reached Moscow, Olgerd again burned the city, which the
people had barely had time to rebuild since his first blow. He did not attack the
Kremlin, however, where Dmitri himself was commanding. The metropolitan was absent
in Nizni, whither he had gone to baptize a newly born grandson of Olgerd, the son
of Boris of Gorodets.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Vladimir, the cousin of the Grand Prince of Moscow, was gathering his forces
and marching on Olgerd. Even troops from Ryazan were hurrying forward with assistance
to Moscow. Olgerd now proposed permanent peace and alliance. In proof of his sincerity
he offered his daughter to Dmitri’s cousin, Vladimir. The Grand Prince refused peace,
but made a truce for six months.
</p>
<p>Thus ended Olgerd’s stay of eight days before the Kremlin. The haste, and the care
with which he retreated, show that numerous forces were following. He had not found
the Grand Prince unprepared, and had boasted vainly in Vilna, for he did not break
fast in Moscow. His fear and his hurried retreat prove how little he trusted in truces
or in treaties.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">BATTLE OF KULIKOVO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Michael, deserted by Olgerd, made peace with Dmitri but only to go to the Horde, which
he visited January, 1371. Judging by what he accomplished, he was received well by
Mamai, who ruled the Horde then through his creature, Khan Mamant Sultan. Michael
got not only a patent for the Grand Principality, but an offer of troops against Dmitri
“the rebel,” for such was Dmitri in the eyes of Mamai, at least officially. Michael
refused the troops, and only took Sari Hodja, the envoy. The good-will of Mamai and
the new Khan cost Michael much treasure, for besides what he carried to Sarai, he
was forced to a debt of ten thousand grievens, an immense sum for that time, and as
surety he engaged to send his son, Ivan, to Mamai.
</p>
<p>Moscow had agents at the Horde always, and from these men Dmitri knew the situation
even before Michael had turned his face homeward. Agents were sent to each city to
bring all to oath that they would not accept Michael, and would not permit him to
be Prince of Vladimir. All people were on the side of Dmitri, and he and his cousin,
at the head of a large army, at once moved against Pereyaslavl.
</p>
<p>When Michael arrived and announced his appointment, the Vladimir men would not receive
him. They sent word to him that they did not believe he had a patent, and he was forced
to retreat. Sari Hodja, Michael’s Mongol friend, summoned Dmitri to Vladimir to hear
the Khan’s patent read. “I will not go to the reading,” replied Dmitri. “I will not
let any one enter Vladimir, and to thee, O envoy, thy way is open.” But the boyars
who carried this answer were to give Sari Hodja gifts of honor, and in private invite
him to make Moscow happy with his presence.
</p>
<p>Sari Hodja, who had received rich gifts from Prince Michael, <span class="pageNum" id="pb359">[<a href="#pb359">359</a>]</span>hesitated. He expressed great reverence for the Tver prince, and conducted him to
the Mologa, where he delivered the Khan’s patent. He spoke long of his unfailing devotion,
then took farewell. After that Sari Hodja went straightway to Moscow, where they gave
him more gifts than he had ever dreamed possible. He marveled at the beauty and excellence
of the city, and praised Dmitri for his winning ways, and his kindness. He complained,
however, that the Grand Prince had not visited the loving Khan, from whom he guaranteed
a good reception. At parting he repeated that he would never forget Dmitri, and when
at the Horde would tell of his kindness.
</p>
<p>It was time indeed for Dmitri to beware of breaking with the Mongols. More than once
sharp reminders had come from Mamai, and even war had been threatened. Michael, armed
with the Khan’s patent, was taking district after district and installing his agents
in every disputed place. Novgorod men had informed Michael that if he were in truth
appointed instead of Dmitri, they were ready to kiss the cross to him.
</p>
<p>Dmitri counseled with his boyars and the metropolitan: “Should he make war on the
Horde; or should he take refuge in phrases?” No matter how grievous was the latter,
his advisers feared to counsel resistance, hence Dmitri decided that he would go to
the Khan and come to terms with him if possible. When this decision was published,
there was deep discouragement in Moscow. All feared an evil issue, and Dmitri wrote
his will before starting. The metropolitan went with him to the <span class="corr" id="xd32e3034" title="Source: Oka">Oká</span>, and blessed him at parting. Soon after the departure of the Grand Prince, envoys
came from Olgerd to conclude peace with Moscow. Prince Vladimir and the council of
boyars, with the metropolitan at the head of it, made peace with Lithuania. Then followed
the betrothal of Yelena, Olgerd’s daughter, to Dmitri’s cousin, Vladimir; some months
later the marriage was solemnized. Such favorable news came from the Horde that there
was no evil word for Sari Hodja in Moscow. At Sarai they rejoiced at Dmitri’s arrival.
His grandfather, Kalitá, had been Uzbek’s friend. Dmitri was a nephew of Simeon the
Proud and a son of Ivan, Simeon’s brother. All those princes had been faithful friends
of the Horde, and had always obeyed it. Dmitri received great honor. The gifts that
he had brought to Mamai, to the Khan and his wives, and to magnates <span class="pageNum" id="pb360">[<a href="#pb360">360</a>]</span>were such as had not been seen for a long time. Other princes could not bring as rich
gifts at that period. When Dmitri learned that Ivan, son of Michael, was in pledge
at the Horde for ten thousand grievens, he offered the money immediately, and they
answered that he might take the youth and keep him till all was paid back by his father.
Mamai and Dmitri met face to face and took note of each other. They examined the lists
of tribute, a work which, though tedious, was finished at last with satisfaction.
A patent was given to the Grand Prince and he returned home; with him went notable
envoys, who conducted Ivan, son of Michael, and delivered him in Moscow as pledge
for his father’s debt.
</p>
<p>Dmitri learned later that he had not left the Horde before the following Mongol message
was sent to Michael of Tver: “We gave thee the Grand Principality, and offered troops
to install thee. Thou didst refuse both our power and our warriors, resolving to sit
in the Grand Principality with thy own force. Ask no aid of us further; but sit there
with the assistance of whomever may please thee.”
</p>
<p>So Dmitri returned to Moscow with good results and much honor, having strengthened
his position, and in all questions put his enemies to shame. He began at once to restore
the integrity of Moscow’s possessions, destroyed in his absence by Michael, who had
occupied some Moscow towns on the border, and ravaged others. After his instalment
at Novgorod, Michael had replaced Dmitri’s agents with his own men, and Novgorod had
given him an oath paper. When Dmitri returned from the Horde with a new patent and
honor, Novgorod broke immediately with Michael, and joined Moscow.
</p>
<p>The next year, 1372, the war became more determined, especially since Ryazan was on
Michael’s side. It was clear that Tver and Ryazan were leagued against Moscow more
unsparingly than ever, and against Novgorod, which was now aiding Moscow. Olgerd,
who had given his daughter in marriage to Dmitri’s cousin, Vladimir, refrained from
action for a time. But even from the beginning, his restraint seemed like ridicule,
for he sent a number of princes with succor to Michael: Prince Drutskoi, Andrei, the
Polotsk prince, one of his own sons, his brother, Keistut, and his son, Vitold; who
brought with them many Poles and Lithuanians. Moscow again had to meet, not so much
Tver, as Olgerd.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb361">[<a href="#pb361">361</a>]</span></p>
<p>The war with Ryazan was ended in one crushing battle. The daring Oleg of Ryazan had
shown himself hostile to Moscow in the days of Dmitri’s father, and had claimed, if
not all places joined to Kolomna, at least those included with Lopasnya. When Olgerd
invaded Moscow the second time, Ryazan troops helped Dmitri. A Pronsk prince, however,
commanded them, and those princes defended themselves against the Ryazan prince through
their friendship with Moscow. Oleg now demanded Lopasnya as the price of his aid against
Olgerd, and this caused a break between him and Dmitri. Dmitri replied that they had
not defended Moscow, they had stood only on their own boundary; that Olgerd had burned
and ruined Moscow. But Dmitri, lest Oleg might complain to the Khan, said he would
discuss with him the question of boundaries. Oleg wished for something more real than
promises, so he took Lopasnya with a strong hand, and held it,—occupied the region
that he wanted.
</p>
<p>The hatred between the people under Dmitri and Oleg reached back to the days of Big
Nest, when Moscow was nothing but the Kutchkovo village and Ryazan men broke in through
Lopasnya and plundered it cruelly. But Moscow had grown enormously since that time.
It had become the chief city, called its ruler Grand Prince of All Russia, and looked
upon the Ryazan men as “raging, arrogant, savage, half-witted people.”
</p>
<p>Dmitri had a veteran leader, a man of rare gifts and long practice, a leader tried
in many campaigns, knowing well the tricks of war and the meaning of every move made
by an enemy; besides, he was Dmitri’s chief confidant, his brother-in-law, married
to his sister, Anna. Men usually called him Prince Volynski, adding the nickname,
Bobrok. This Bobrok of Volynia was now to chasten Oleg, the Ryazan prince.
</p>
<p>Oleg, who had assembled an army, marched out against Moscow. The battle was merciless;
one of the most renowned conflicts of that epoch. The name of the field, Skornistchevo,
on which it took place, was made famous. Oleg fought stubbornly, but notwithstanding
his valor and bravery, he had to flee with a few attendants. Bobrok took Ryazan, and
placed there Vladimir of Pronsk.
</p>
<p>Michael of Tver undertook now to harass the heart of the Moscow possessions. The week
after Easter his allies surprised <span class="pageNum" id="pb362">[<a href="#pb362">362</a>]</span>Pereyaslavl, which they plundered and burned, leaving naught save the fortress behind
them. Next they seized all the neighboring settlements. Keistut struck this blow with
such suddenness that he surprised men at work in the fields, and on the road going
to market or elsewhere, but he could not capture the fortress. The Tver prince, attacking
Dmitroff, plundered it, and led away multitudes of people. Then the allies turned
on Kashin and ruined it. The Kashin prince hastened to Moscow. The allies went home,
but the Tver prince, on reaching Torjok, seized the town, and installed his officials.
News came now that Olgerd was approaching, and the place was declared where Michael
was to meet him.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dmitri sent men to Torjok, and from Novgorod came boyars and others. They
expelled Tver officials; those who did not escape they took captive. They stopped
Tver merchants and seized their property. News that Torjok had gone over to Dmitri,
and that Novgorod was on that side, enraged Michael. He hastened with all his troops
to Torjok, to that “adjunct of Tver,” as he called it. “Yield up those who have seized
my people and robbed them. Put back my lieutenants; I ask nothing further,” was Michael’s
demand, and from daylight he waited till midday.
</p>
<p>In Torjok at that moment were Novgorod men famed as great warriors,—among them Abakumovitch,
notorious for freebooting trips on the Volga, and elsewhere; but especially renowned
for that exploit which seemed a miracle, and beyond human strength: the courageous
and desperate journey along the Ob River, through all Siberia. With him were other
“daredevils,” and “Novgorod land pirates.” These men would not yield to the Tver prince.
They raised a great shout of defiance, and gathering their forces, marched out against
him.
</p>
<p>Abakumovitch fell in the first shock of the encounter. The battle was merciless, but
Michael was the victor. Some fled from the field to save themselves, others hastened
back to the stronghold. Michael’s men fired the town from that side whence the wind
came. The wind was fierce on that day, and the flames consumed everything. The destruction
was absolute. Some, in trying to save their property, were burned in their houses
or courtyards; others fled to the Church of the Redeemer and were stifled by smoke,
or, <span class="pageNum" id="pb363">[<a href="#pb363">363</a>]</span>rushing out of the fire and the town, were seized by the enemy; many more were drowned
in the river while fleeing. Michael’s warriors were furious, raging. They stripped
women and maidens, some of whom, from shame, drowned themselves; they stripped monks
and nuns, doing what even pagans had not dreamed of doing. Torjok had never suffered
so greatly, even from Mongols.
</p>
<p>The unexpected movement of Moscow troops and of Moscow’s allies toward Kaluga informed
all that Olgerd was coming. This time every measure had been taken to prevent his
drawing near to the capital. Less than two weeks after Torjok had been ruined the
Tver prince was at Lyubutsk, whither Olgerd was hastening, and where, somewhat later,
the two armies joined forces. Oleg of Ryazan was instructed to march thither also.
The forces of Moscow were marching toward the same place.
</p>
<p>On the twelfth of June there was a desperate battle, and Olgerd for the first time
was thoroughly beaten in those regions. He withdrew, or rather fled, but Dmitri followed
on closely. Olgerd halted in a place intersected with gullies, and strengthened his
position on heights well secured in steep, rocky places. Dmitri halted directly opposite
and entrenched himself. The two forces stood face to face, and remained many days
there, watching each other. Only a wooded ravine, abrupt and steep, lay between them.
</p>
<p>Olgerd, who had planned to surprise his opponents, fell into a trap, and had at last
to ask peace of Dmitri. We have not all the details of that peace, but enough are
preserved to give an idea of the advantage gained by Moscow. Olgerd was on the verge
of destruction, and only because of that did he accept the peace given. With this
peace hostilities with Tver and Lithuania ended, so far as a treaty could end them.
Lithuania and Tver bound themselves not to invade Moscow lands in future; and Olgerd
was not to take the part of his brother-in-law. All the places seized by Michael were
to be returned, and all the property restored to the owners. Tver officials must be
removed, if not Dmitri had the right to eject them. Peace with Tver was concluded
with a special agreement by which Michael’s son, Ivan, at that time in Moscow, would
be free when his father paid the debt incurred by Dmitri because of him.
</p>
<p>But barely had Moscow by this victory in the west over Olgerd turned away every danger
on that side, when she was threatened <span class="pageNum" id="pb364">[<a href="#pb364">364</a>]</span>by the Mongols. Mamai, enraged at the growing success of Dmitri, was the more incensed
by his want of respect for the Mongols. Not only were all princes of the “Lower Land,”
even those of Tver and Ryazan, in subjection to Moscow, so that Dmitri seemed to be
more important than the Khan, and his commands to be obeyed with more accuracy, but
it seems besides that Dmitri had not paid tribute in recent days. In every case, in
treaties with the princes of that time, this clause was added: “Whether we are to
be at peace or war with the Mongols, to give the Horde tribute, or refuse it, of that
we are to decide in common.”
</p>
<p>When Mamai made war on the Grand Prince, he alleged as chief cause non-payment of
tribute. Dmitri, to ward off invasion, gave an obligation to stop no stipulated payment.
Mamai then demanded more than had been agreed upon. Moreover, the princes of Ryazan
and Nizni regions, and other subordinates of Moscow, treated rudely, and even insulted
the Mongols, and when they had learned to insult they went further,—they attacked
the Khan’s warriors. To inspire obedience in Dmitri’s chief ally, his father-in-law,
Saraiko, a murza, was sent by the Khan from Sarai to Nizni. But the Nizni prince,
who no doubt consulted with Dmitri, had no fear of the envoy. Seeing that Saraiko
had with him a thousand attendants, the Nizni prince lodged these Mongols in different
places, as if to show honor. Saraiko, though maintained in luxury, was, as it were,
in detention.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince had his well-wishers in Sarai, and paid his friends there liberally.
They lived under various disguises, but were getting information for Moscow at all
times. From them news was brought that Mamai, who had long threatened Moscow, had
decided at last to accomplish his wishes. But Moscow was ready, and the troops sent
by Mamai to punish the city merely ravaged Ryazan, which, as things stood at that
time, was no injury to Moscow.
</p>
<p>All the summer of 1373 Dmitri had his main forces on the bank of the Oká, and had
divisions widely disposed waiting for the Mongols. The Mongols, on their part, had
friends in Moscow and secret spies everywhere. They had information that Moscow was
looking for uninvited guests, hence they did not cross the Oká.
</p>
<p>If 1373, the year following the Tver peace, passed quietly for Moscow, it was because
a strong army stood “on the brink,” <span class="pageNum" id="pb365">[<a href="#pb365">365</a>]</span>and did not let in the Mongols from Ryazan parts. There was perfect concord in the
Grand Prince’s family. The devotion of his cousin, Vladimir, seemed reflected in the
boyars and officials. The greater number of the boyars had served Kalitá also. Young
men followed old, but the families continued. For example a descendant of Protasi,
a noted boyar in Kalitá’s time, was commander in Moscow for Dmitri, and his brother,
Timofei, was renowned as a voevoda and counselor. The commander himself, Vassili Velyaminoff,
who died in 1374, left three sons, men as faithful as he had been, except one, who
gave truth to the proverb: “No family without a deformity.” One of Velyaminoff’s sons
had married the sister of Dmitri’s wife; and the other son, Polyekt, was connected
with a princely house also. One of Dmitri’s sons had married Polyekt’s daughter.
</p>
<p>Ivan Kvashnya, another of the Grand Prince’s intimate boyars, commanding beyond the
Volga, was a son of Rodion Nestorvitch, renowned under Kalitá. Feodor Svibl was a
great-grandson of <span class="corr" id="xd32e3076" title="Source: Akinf">Akinfi</span>, a Moscow boyar, who was killed while serving Tver, after leaving the service of
Moscow. Still another, Feodor Kashka, was a son of the noted Andrei Kobyla, more correctly
Kambil (this Andrei Kambil was the ancestor of the Romanoffs, now reigning in Russia).
Dmitri had also many faithful servants and friends, who had come to Moscow during
his own reign. First among these recent men was Dmitri, the Volynian prince called
Bobrok, who had married Anna, the sister of the Grand Prince. There was a wonderous
zeal in serving Dmitri; only one rebel appeared, the son of Vassili Velyaminoff, who
left three sons: Mikula, Polyekt, and a third named Ivan.
</p>
<p>When the commander died Dmitri did not appoint any one to take the place left vacant
by him. This offended Ivan, who had hoped to receive the office. Being disappointed,
he began an intrigue, or more correctly a conspiracy. He found no confederate among
boyars or the people. A merchant in silk and Eastern stuffs, a certain Nekomat, became
his associate. Whether he was of Moscow origin, or came from Novgorod, or what were
his habits, no one could declare surely: “Ivan and Nekomat began work with many lies
to the ruin of people,” is what the chronicler states of them. They went to Tver and
roused Michael to strive again for the patent. They assured the Tver prince that many
people <span class="pageNum" id="pb366">[<a href="#pb366">366</a>]</span>in Moscow would rise to assist him. “We have associates everywhere,” said they. They
persuaded Michael that success at the Horde was beyond peradventure. Nekomat appeared
as a man who knew the Horde well, and was conversant with every affair among Mongols.
Of course it was not because of what these men could do, or say, that Mamai upheld
Michael. But they undertook to work for the Tver prince at the Horde because Mamai
was enraged at Dmitri. And they met with success.
</p>
<p>Not only was Michael appointed Grand Prince again, but Mamai engaged to send an army;
Michael this time had begged for Mongol warriors. Atchi Hodja, the envoy, brought
the Khan’s patent, but he did not bring the warriors. Thereupon Michael turned to
Olgerd for aid, and, while waiting for men from the Horde and Lithuania, broke the
peace with Moscow. He sent envoys to renounce the oath given Dmitri.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince was not slow in his answer; he summoned his allies and commanded
them all to hasten. Then, collecting his forces, he marched toward Volok, whither
his subordinates and allies were hurrying. They assembled quickly and in formidable
numbers. Their rage against Michael was boundless. “How many times has he brought
Olgerd against us; how much harm has he done, and how often? Now he is on the Khan’s
side, and assisting him. If we let Michael go further, the Mongols will destroy us.”
And from Volok they marched directly against Tver. Michael shut himself in for a siege
there, and strengthened his chief city quickly. The besiegers, to reach the place,
built two bridges over the Volga. The Novgorod men, remembering Michael’s recent offense,
and how Torjok had been ruined, hastened to Dmitri’s assistance. Tver men fought with
desperate valor, quenching fires and repairing breaches. While the siege was progressing,
Staretsa Zubtsoff and other towns fell to Moscow, which, with its allies, seized every
place on the march, and took captives. They destroyed or mastered all things.
</p>
<p>No matter how great might be Michael’s resistance, he was vanquished. He could have
no hope of Mongol aid, or of aid from Olgerd. The Lithuanians did come, but when they
drew near they hesitated, then turned and marched home. From the Horde was heard no
word of any kind; famine touched Tver decisively. Michael, overpowered at all points,
was forced to <span class="pageNum" id="pb367">[<a href="#pb367">367</a>]</span>depute the Tver bishop and the oldest boyars to ask peace of the Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>Dmitri gave a stern peace, but a just one. He deprived Michael forever of the claim
to rival Moscow, and subjected him to Moscow primacy. He permitted him to style himself,
and to be within certain limits Grand Prince in Tver regions; but it was established
that Kashin must be independent of Michael. Every clause was defined very strictly,
and in case of dispute Dmitri agreed to let Oleg of Ryazan act as arbiter. No man
could think of Oleg as partial to Moscow. Further Michael was not to seek Moscow,
or the Grand Principality, or Novgorod for himself, or his children, or any of his
family, and was not to accept the Grand Principality of Vladimir from the Mongols.
</p>
<p>On his part Dmitri was not to take Tver under any circumstances. The following article
is noteworthy: “Whether we are to be at peace with the Horde, or to give tribute will
be decided in council together. If the Mongols attack any prince, we are all to resist.
Should the Grand Prince of Moscow move on the Horde, the Tver prince must go with
him.”
</p>
<p>Michael abjured all alliance with Olgerd, his brothers, and his family. Further he
bound himself to fight against Lithuania, should it attack Moscow, or any Moscow ally.
Boyars and free men might pass from one prince to the other, rights were considered
as equal on both sides in this regard; two men were excluded, however, Ivan and Nekomat;
their property was forfeited, and they themselves declared traitors.
</p>
<p>Thus ended that bloody war of 1375 between Tver and Moscow, and there was quiet for
a time. But even now Michael did not yield in his heart; he still hoped to triumph
over Dmitri. He did not relinquish his alliance with Olgerd. On the contrary, he worked
hard to strengthen it. That very year his son, Ivan, pledged lately for the Horde
debt, married Olgerd’s niece, Keistut’s daughter. Lithuania waged war on Smolensk
for co-operation with Moscow. Olgerd’s forces burned, plundered, and led captive.
“Why did ye help ruin Tver?” asked they, as they taunted their victims. The Lithuanian
friendship brought less fruit, however, than Michael had hoped from it.
</p>
<p>One year and six months later, 1377, Olgerd died, and then began grave and protracted
disorders. Yagello killed Keistut, his <span class="pageNum" id="pb368">[<a href="#pb368">368</a>]</span>uncle, and married Yedviga of Poland, thus causing new and great complications.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the storm on the west apparently subsided, than another storm moved
from the east against Moscow.
</p>
<p>The Mongols attacked Nizni-Novgorod and ravaged it unsparingly, thus striking the
Grand Prince through his allies, the chief one of whom was his father-in-law. “Why
did ye help Moscow, and march against Tver?” asked they, as they plundered Nizni.
Farther south they declared: “We do thus because ye fought against the Tver prince.”
</p>
<p>Nizni men rose now to take revenge; they killed Saraiko, the envoy, and his thousand
attendants. This happened while Dmitri of Nizni was absent and his son was ruling
for a short time. The old prince, fearing a Mongol attack on his city, had commanded
to hold Saraiko’s men apart from him. When Vassili, the prince’s son, obeyed these
instructions, Saraiko became alarmed, and fled to the episcopal palace with a few
of his attendants. This flight seemed an attack to some people, and they rose to protect
the bishop. Mongols, in self-defense, used arrows, one of which, without wounding
the bishop, stuck fast in his mantle. This roused a whole multitude, who rushed to
clear the palace of Mongols. A struggle began which extended till Saraiko had fallen,
with all of his attendants. “The pagan thought,” said the people, “to do what he wanted,
but he and all of his men with him have perished.” After this December, 1375, and
January, 1376, the territories of Nizni in all of their extent, from the east to the
Sura, and south to the Piana, were doomed to fire and the sword without mercy.
</p>
<p>Dmitri of Moscow went beyond the Oká with an army to guard against Mongol forces,
which, as he heard, were advancing. The Grand Prince, in defending the lands of his
father-in-law, found it needful to fill the Trans-Sura with a great dread of Russia.
He sent strong detachments under Bobrok of Volynia, with Ivan and Vassili, two sons
of the Nizni prince. They marched to the present Kazan, and their victory was signal.
Kazan rendered homage to the Grand Prince’s leader by giving him two thousand rubles,
in the money of their period, and three thousand rubles to the army. Kazan received
a Moscow official and engaged to pay tribute. The Khan counted those lands as his
own beyond <span class="pageNum" id="pb369">[<a href="#pb369">369</a>]</span>question, hence this victory increased Mamai’s rage very greatly.
</p>
<p>In 1377 news came from beyond the Sura that a new Mongol prince, Arabshah, had appeared
there and fixed his camp at a place called Volchi Vodi (Wolf Water), but that place,
as it seemed, was not enough; he was extending his power in many directions. The terror
of his name touched Kazan, and the Volga, and alarmed Nizni also. The Nizni prince
begged aid of Moscow a second time. The affair seemed so serious that Dmitri himself
went with his forces. As there were no tidings of the new conqueror, Dmitri, after
waiting a fortnight, returned to his capital; he left, however, a part of his forces
composed of men from Vladimir and Murom.
</p>
<p>Soon reports came of Arabshah and his army. People said that he was near, but no one
knew in what spot he was lurking. Scouts made fruitless efforts to find him. At last
the Nizni prince sent forward his son, Ivan, with a Novgorod force, and sent also
the Moscow commanders with the regiments left by Dmitri. They were to cross the Piana,
and guard the lands south of it. Finding themselves in a primitive region, called
by the Russians in those days “The Wild Fields,” these warriors had no fear of natives;
they thought only to amuse themselves. There were but a few villages, and those few
were in secluded places; a person might pass very near and not see them. The country
was one of forests and grass; it was well-watered, abounding in game, and in honey.
Prince Ivan and his men found life there agreeable. They went hunting, and moved about
everywhere, thoughtless of peril, taking no precautions whatever.
</p>
<p>Soon news came that Arabshah was approaching. Still there was no trace of him anywhere.
The wily natives were hiding Mamai’s forces, which were lurking very near the Nizni
army. They had been led in unobserved, and had surrounded the Russians completely.
On August 2, 1377, they destroyed Ivan’s men,—it may be said, without fighting. The
Mongols, arranged in five divisions, struck at once from five sides, and only when
attacked and facing death did the men of that camp gain their senses. They grasped
for their shields, swords and lances. No one had weapons at hand; some were in cases,
others in wagons; some warriors were half dressed. The slaughter was thorough. The
Mongols had only to strike, thrust, and hew down their victims. <span class="pageNum" id="pb370">[<a href="#pb370">370</a>]</span>Prince Ivan sprang into the river on horseback, and was drowned there. Thousands of
common men, and many officers, perished.
</p>
<p>Three days later the triumphant Mongols were at Nizni. The prince, having no men to
defend the place, fled to Suzdal. Those who had means to flee saved themselves. Those
who had not means were slain, or went into captivity. The city was burned, and on
August 7 the Mongols turned back, taking with them a multitude of captives. Of Nizni
there remained little but charred ruins.
</p>
<p>Prince Dmitri Kirdyapa searched for the body of his brother, which he at last found,
and buried in the single stone church left in Nizni. Thirty-two churches had been
burned.
</p>
<p>Reports now came that Arabshah was slaying all who had survived beyond the Sura, but
this was not true.
</p>
<p>Arabshah was seeking new fields, and soon fell on Ryazan. Oleg met him and was terribly
defeated. The Ryazan prince came very near being captured. Wounded and covered with
blood, he tore himself free of the Mongols and escaped. About this time another calamity
befell the Nizni region; it was visited by a robber attack of the “Filthy Mordva,”
as the natives were called by the Russians. The Nizni prince, coming home at that
juncture, set out to punish those “eaters of hedgehogs and wolves” for their attack,
and their perfidy in bringing in Mongols by stealth to kill Russians. Boris, Ivan’s
youngest brother, hunted some of those robbers into the Piana; the greater part of
the others were slain; very few went back to their haunts beyond the river. But the
people in Moscow were not satisfied with this punishment. They resolved to seize the
elders who had led in the Mongols, and to fill with terror the whole region lying
south of the Piana.
</p>
<p>In January, 1378, Dmitri of Moscow sent men to his father-in-law. One of his best
leaders, Svibla, went with them. The Moscow men entered the land where their friends
had been slaughtered, and cut down the inhabitants. Throughout the winter villages
vanished at touch of the Russians. Some of the elders were slain straightway when
captured, others were taken to Nizni and hunted to death with dogs on the ice of the
Volga.
</p>
<p>The Mordva land was considered by the Mongols as not the least among those lands which
belonged to their Khan. The death of its elders for assisting Horde warriors roused
Mamai’s wrath to the utmost, and he resolved to punish Moscow most famously.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb371">[<a href="#pb371">371</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nizni, which had recovered somewhat from the first Mongol destruction, was destroyed
now a second time. The old prince, who had fled to his brother Boris at Gorodets,
sent word that he would pay a ransom. Every ransom was rejected. They made the whole
province empty, and rushed home to join the men making ready to punish Dmitri of Moscow.
</p>
<p>The Mongol army assembled in vast numbers. It marched under many princes. The chief
leader was one of Mamai’s greatest warriors, Baigitch, his faithful assistant. Moscow
forces were mustered with promptness. Dmitri at that time was friendly with Oleg,
the Ryazan prince, who agreed to give prompt aid against Mamai. It was only ten miles
beyond Oleg’s chief city that Dmitri met the whole Mongol army encamped on the Voja.
The opponents found themselves face to face with the river between them. The Mongols
were on the left bank, the Russians on the right, where, unobserved by the enemy,
they had found a good place for battle, and fixed their camp near it.
</p>
<p>August 11, 1378, the Mongols, thinking to crush their opponents by numbers, crossed
the Voja. The time was past midday. They had no thought of fighting immediately, but
Dmitri did not give his foe time to rest, or select a place after crossing. He rushed
with all speed to the struggle. The Pronsk prince attacked one flank, Velyaminoff
the other. Dmitri himself struck the center. The battle, though fierce, was not long
in duration. The Mongols were broken at all points, and before night the whole bank
was strewn with their corpses. The remnant, in recrossing the river, were drowned
in great numbers. The victors could not hunt the enemy in darkness, and this saved
a few of the Khan’s men. Next morning, though a dense fog covered the country, pursuit
was resumed. The vanquished had cast aside everything; their road was well marked
with weapons, carts, and baggage, but they themselves were far away. Complete victory
came from this battle. Baigitch was left dead on the field, as were many Horde magnates.
</p>
<p>On August 30, 1379, at four o’clock after midday, the first man put to death publicly
in Moscow was beheaded. Ivan, son of Vassili Velyaminoff, was taken to the Kutchkovo
Polye. That great square was crowded with people, and when the criminal, whose father
and whole family had been loved and honored by the city, was brought forth, tears
stood in the eyes of many, and when <span class="pageNum" id="pb372">[<a href="#pb372">372</a>]</span>the sword glistened and fell, a groan filled the place. A little more than two years
later there was a similar spectacle on the same spot. Nekomat had been found and he
also was beheaded for high treason.
</p>
<p>The battle on the Voja raised Moscow’s position immensely. “God assisted the Grand
Prince; the Mongols turned and fled,” was the general statement, and was received
as a harbinger of freedom from the Mongols, the dawn of a brighter and better period.
</p>
<p>The great worker, the good metropolitan Alexis, died that same year, six months before
the battle. As they stood around his grave, the people remembered, with tears, all
his labors, and their petition was “Forget us not, in thy prayers, O Alexis, for thy
words before God are effective.” Dmitri stood at the coffin with Vassili, his heir,
then six years of age, and another son of four, with his cousin, Vladimir, and many
other princes. Dmitri, the godson of Alexis, could remember well how he, a boy of
eight years, had met the metropolitan on his return from the Horde after curing Berdibek’s
mother, Taidula, bringing back her signet-ring, and great honor.
</p>
<p>Alexis lived to the age of eighty-five. With his office he had inherited many difficult
tasks from Feognost, who preceded him. There were many troubles in the Church at that
time. Alexis had suffered much from intrigues at the Byzantine capital, where, through
the influence of Poland, a metropolitan was appointed for Galitch; and another for
Lithuania and Rus through the influence of Olgerd. Both of these laid claim to authority
which belonged to Alexis by right and historically, hence the struggle was endless,
and the final solution seemed exceedingly difficult, if not absolutely impossible.
</p>
<p>But the greatest of all griefs and the worst was that caused by Dmitri, the Grand
Prince. It came about as follows: In the time of Ivan Kalitá, the church Spas na Ború
had been founded, and some years later a monastery was built near it. This monastery
was favored beyond others by the Grand Prince; not only its abbot, but its monks had
high honor. The people of Moscow esteemed very greatly a deep noble voice in church
service. There was a priest then in Moscow whose voice surpassed all that men remembered.
This priest so pleased the Grand Prince that he raised him from low degree to such
a height that people fell to asking with curiosity: “Who is this Mityai? Why has he
power <span class="pageNum" id="pb373">[<a href="#pb373">373</a>]</span>and importance?” It proved that Mityai was the son of a priest from Kolomna, who had
a church in Tashilov. This priest had been able to rear his son carefully, and settle
him in Kolomna. Men said of Mityai that he was skilled in letters, a master at reading
and singing, and at quoting from records. He knew the church service to perfection.
He could find a proverb for any case. In a word he was dexterous in many things. He
so enchanted the Grand Prince that Dmitri made him his confidant, then seal-keeper,
and sometime later his confessor. In this position he passed many years most successfully.
</p>
<p>The Spas na Ború abbot, whom the people named “Drink Not,” because he not only drank
nothing spirituous himself, but would not permit any monk under him to use liquor,
was relieved of his office, and shut himself up in a cell for meditation and silence.
Mityai became a monk, and then was made abbot in Ioann’s place. This happened when
Alexis was aged and failing, about two years before his last day came. He was not,
perhaps, greatly astonished to see the seal-keeper made abbot, but the haste in making
him a monk had offended the metropolitan deeply. Notwithstanding all this, and while
Mityai was no more than a novice, Dmitri said, in the presence of Alexis, that the
abbot would make a grand metropolitan.
</p>
<p>These were not chance words, which might be recalled upon second thought; they were
said purposely to define the position. The only reply was silence. After that Dmitri
asked the metropolitan to bless the abbot as his successor. Alexis was unwilling;
Dmitri insisted, and thus it continued for a long time. The metropolitan listened
with mildness, not wishing to offend by refusal, but he did not give the blessing.
</p>
<p>Time passed; the insistence continued. Dmitri did not desist; the metropolitan, though
mild, was unbending. Dmitri’s requests became more emphatic, more frequent, and finally
seemed demands. He beset the metropolitan, he sent the oldest boyars to ask for the
blessing, and Alexis said at last with vexation, or weariness: “I will consent if
God, His Holy Mother, the Patriarch and an Oecumenical Council will bless him.” They
took his words as consent, and announced that the metropolitan had named a successor.
</p>
<p>As soon as Alexis was dead, Mityai left his position of abbot, <span class="pageNum" id="pb374">[<a href="#pb374">374</a>]</span>and, by order of Dmitri, took the highest office and performed most of the duties
that pertained to it. The death of Alexis roused great excitement. Cyprian, then acting
in Kief, declared himself Metropolitan of all Russia. But meanwhile there was a crisis
in Tsargrad. The Patriarch Philotheos, who had ordained Cyprian, was expelled. Makarios,
who succeeded him, did not hold the ordination of Cyprian as binding, and was quick
to seize the situation. He wrote to Moscow immediately, asking them not to recognize
Cyprian, but to send all the papers in Mityai’s case. He honored Mityai as the first
priest of Moscow, and intrusted the Church to him till he could be installed as chief
pastor in Russia; he also invited him to Tsargrad.
</p>
<p>The dislike of the people for Cyprian was changed now to something like sympathy,
though they knew little of his good or bad qualities. They were offended by the brusque,
dictatorial way of the Patriarch at Tsargrad. The people thought that, inspired by
hope of gain, Makarios was favoring Mityai, and they were deeply angered. At the report
that he had been installed, Mityai became hateful to them. This meant favor for Cyprian.
</p>
<p>During Mityai’s tenure of office, February, 1378, to August, 1379, there was a new
crisis in Tsargrad. Andronicus, the Emperor, was dethroned, and Makarios, the Patriarch,
excluded. The new Patriarch decided in favor of Mityai, so the exclusion of Makarios
was not harmful to Mityai; it only delayed his affair, since the new Patriarch, Nilos,
was not installed,—he was only appointed. Meanwhile, Mityai enjoyed every right of
his office, save the power to ordain men. The chronicler states that no one had so
much glory and honor in Moscow as Mityai. At that time he seemed the very model of
majesty. Imposing of stature, lofty and vigorous, with a flowing beard and a beautiful
countenance, of smooth and clear speech, a master of ancient sayings, and of proverbs
from books, from spiritual experience, and from popular knowledge, he surpassed all
men in dignity of mind and body. No man in his office had dressed in such taste, and
so imposingly.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince was delighted; he was flattered by the success of his favorite and
adviser. But by common men and the clergy, Mityai was detested; none desired him.
Bishops, abbots and monks were imploring Heaven not to let Mityai become metropolitan.
Mityai relied on the Grand Prince, and cared not <span class="pageNum" id="pb375">[<a href="#pb375">375</a>]</span>a whit for his enemies. All the more were people opposed to him that he was haughty,
stern and harsh to subordinates; he judged them himself, by his own power, and punished
severely.
</p>
<p>News was received now that Cyprian was approaching Moscow with a train of attendants
and servants requiring forty-six horses. Measures were taken at once not to admit
him. Couriers with letters addressed to him were seized; sentries were stationed in
needed places to stop him, and, as Cyprian neared Moscow, he was arrested. The boyars
sent to capture him took all his property, covered him with ridicule and curses, and
confined him, without food, in a damp, loathsome chamber. Envoys from the Patriarch,
traveling with Cyprian, were insulted. They, with their Patriarch and Emperor, were
called “Lithuanians.” What the servants of Cyprian had was taken from them; they were
seated on their horses without saddles, and the horses were lashed away from the city.
The next day at nightfall, after Cyprian had been twenty-four hours without food,
and in confinement, he was conducted from Moscow by the boyars who had seized him.
Stopping at no great distance from the city, Cyprian wrote to Sergai and Feodor, the
abbots, touching what he had suffered. He opposed the unlawful claims of Mityai, and
cursed the men who had arrested him.
</p>
<p>After this event, Mityai had a talk with the Grand Prince. “It is written in the rules
of the Apostles,” said he, “that two or three bishops may ordain a new bishop. If
I have thy favor, command all the bishops in thy dominion to assemble in Moscow and
ordain me.” Dmitri and his intimate boyars approved of this proposal. It would save
trouble, and the expense of going to Tsargrad. Command was then given to all bishops
in Russia to assemble. They came, one after another, and went to be blessed by the
new, so-called, metropolitan. But Dionisi, the Bishop of Suzdal, being indignant at
Mityai, would not approach him. Bowing to the assembly and the Grand Prince, he spoke
as follows: “We have come at thy command, and we see that thou wishest, through us,
to create a metropolitan, but we may not break the law given to us. Blessing must
be had from the Patriarch. That is the law given anciently.”
</p>
<p>The appointed metropolitan, seeing his plan put to shame, and provoked by men who
incited both him and Dionisi, sent a reprimand to the latter in these words: “Why
not come to me <span class="pageNum" id="pb376">[<a href="#pb376">376</a>]</span>for a blessing? Have I not power over thee, and in the metropolis? Knowest who I am?”
Dionisi then went to Mityai, and answered: “Thou sayst that thou hast power over me;
thou hast none. If thou hast power, say thyself who, according to Scripture, is greater,
a priest or a bishop? It is for thee to bow before me and be blessed, for thou art
a priest, while I am a bishop.” “Thou hast called me a priest?” shouted Mityai. “Me,
an abbot, and an appointed metropolitan! Know then that thou wilt not be even a priest
during my day. With my own hands I will strip off thy vestments; only wait till I
come from the Patriarch!”
</p>
<p>A fierce quarrel rose between them. Dionisi declared that he himself would go to the
Patriarch. The following words may have burst from him: “We shall see who, thou or
I, will be metropolitan!” Mityai told the Grand Prince that Dionisi uttered them,
and begged him to repress the Suzdal bishop.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince detained Dionisi, and a strong guard was placed over him. He was
informed that he could go to Tsargrad only after Mityai had returned. Dmitri was annoyed
beyond measure. The meeting had failed, and there was great scandal. Nothing could
save Mityai now but ordination from the Patriarch. The Grand Prince hastened the journey,
and was ready to do everything to make it successful and splendid. On second thought,
it seemed unsafe to confine the Suzdal bishop. He was respected by the people, his
diocese was important, he had wide connections among the clergy. Dmitri freed him
on this promise: “I will not go to Tsargrad without thy permission; the abbot of the
Troitski monastery will guarantee my promise.” But after returning to his diocese,
and meditating a while, Dionisi sailed down the Volga to Sarai, and hurried off to
Tsargrad, thus breaking his word and betraying his bondman.
</p>
<p>The indignant Mityai, who had urged keeping Dionisi in detention, and had tried to
persuade the Grand Prince not to trust either Dionisi or his bondman, gave full expression
now to his rage against the abbot and the bishop. He represented them as keen and
persistent conspirators against him. Dmitri, confused and saddened, knew not how to
pacify his favorite. Again he advised him to hasten to Tsargrad, and declared that
he was more anxious than ever to make the journey a triumph.
</p>
<p>It was natural that Mityai should look on the Troitski abbot <span class="pageNum" id="pb377">[<a href="#pb377">377</a>]</span>with suspicion. There were reports that the late metropolitan had held secret converse
with the abbot about taking his office, and Mityai found in him, as he thought, a
rival. Either he did not know that Sergai had refused, or he did not believe in the
refusal. He was convinced that Sergai and Dionisi had asked Alexis to keep back his
blessing. Mityai proved to the Grand Prince that the abbot and Dionisi had caused
all the opposition of Alexis, who up to death had not yielded. And if, in his anger,
Mityai had told Dionisi that he would strip off his vestments, he announced to Sergai
in his rage that he would drive out all the Troitski monks, and destroy the whole
monastery. “I pray the Lord,” said Sergai in answer, “not to let the boaster destroy
sacred places and expel blameless persons.” When the monks spoke of Mityai’s departure
and the terror which would return with him, the abbot said merely: “God knows whether
he will ever see Tsargrad, much less be anointed.”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile preparations for the journey were unparalleled. Those who had said recently
that ordination in Moscow would save expense and trouble were only thinking now how
to add grandeur to the occasion. All were aware that the Grand Prince loved Mityai.
No one knew this better than Mityai himself, and he tested it thoroughly. For years
he had been the Grand Prince’s seal-keeper; he knew well that a small sheet of paper
brings death to a man, or brings fortune, if only the name and the seal of the prince
be upon it, and the right words stand above them. So he said to his patron at parting,
“If I have thy favor, give me a few blanks with thy seal and thy name on them. Should
I need a thousand pieces of money, or if a want of some other kind touches me, I can
place on that paper the right words.”
</p>
<p>Dmitri not merely consented, he praised such forethought. “Let it be as thou sayest,”
replied he, and he gave him not one, but a number of papers. In the summer of 1379,
when Mityai started, by way of Kolomna, the Grand Prince, with his children and his
oldest boyars, also bishops and abbots and the clergy, with a concourse of people,
escorted him outside the city. On the journey he was accompanied by three abbots,—Ivan
of Moscow, Pimen of Pereyaslavl, and the abbot from Kolomna, also other clergy, boyars
and servants, “a very great regiment.” They went through Ryazan to Mongol regions.
Mamai had heard that Mityai was <span class="pageNum" id="pb378">[<a href="#pb378">378</a>]</span>going to Tsargrad, and he commanded a halt in the journey. But on learning that an
appointed metropolitan was going to the Patriarch (and no doubt Mityai gave him presents),
he not only left a free road to him, but added also a patent freeing him and the Russian
clergy from tribute. On arriving at Feodosia, they took a Genoese ship, and sailed
over “the abysses of the Euxine.”
</p>
<p>When the Black Sea was behind them, and they were nearing the city of Constantinople,
Mityai fell ill and died suddenly. As soon as land was reached, they buried him in
the suburb of Galata.
</p>
<p>The pastors of the church were greatly troubled, not through losing Mityai, but to
decide who might fill the void left by him. Every one learned quickly what had happened,
and a violent death was mentioned. But a more important question in that “great regiment”
was to find a metropolitan. Some wished Ioann of Moscow, while others insisted on
Pimen. When most men favored Pimen, Joann rose against them, and threatened exposure.
They answered by putting him in irons and choosing Pimen unanimously. Pimen took Mityai’s
robes with all his money and papers. He found the signed blanks, and on one of them
wrote the wish, as it were, of the Grand Prince to make Pimen metropolitan; other
blanks were used to procure money. When Dmitri’s desire was presented to the Council,
the Emperor and Patriarch expressed great surprise, since Russia had a metropolitan
already. At subsequent meetings the surprise was omitted—rich presents had been given
meanwhile. Pimen was confirmed as metropolitan.
</p>
<p>But the trouble which began with Mityai was merely the commencement of disorder, and
drew after it a series which did not end till long after Dmitri’s time. Dmitri found
no rest in Church matters after the day he raised up his favorite, Mityai. “I know
not,” said the Grand Prince, “how the metropolitan died, or how the deceit began.
I did not send Pimen to be metropolitan, and I will not receive him. I have no wish
whatever to see the man.” Somewhat later, Dmitri sent for Cyprian, and received him
with honor at the place where this same Cyprian had been so basely insulted. But during
the ceremony, and even while Dmitri was kissing Cyprian, this message was delivered:
“Pimen, the metropolitan, <span class="pageNum" id="pb379">[<a href="#pb379">379</a>]</span>is journeying from Tsargrad. He has passed through the Horde, and is coming.”
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince would not receive Pimen, who was stopped at Kolomna. His vestments
and his money were taken from him, and he was sent to confinement at Chuhloma. The
“whole regiment” of his counselors and attendants were scattered, and some were imprisoned.
Still later on Cyprian was expelled a second time. The Patriarch took Pimen’s part
and declared Cyprian’s position illegal, and Dmitri received the metropolitan whom
he had refused to see earlier. Pimen, now recognized in Moscow, and welcomed with
solemnity, enjoyed the honor shown previously to Cyprian. Cyprian’s day had been brief;
Pimen’s day was brief also. It was quite impossible to live with that self-made, intriguing
church dignitary.
</p>
<p>At last the Grand Prince decided to appoint Dionisi of Suzdal, the bishop who had
quarreled with Mityai, and who, in spite of his promise, had fled to Tsargrad, and
seen the ordination of Pimen. Dionisi had been raised to the dignity of archbishop
by the Patriarch, who gave office to all men whom he feared through their knowledge
of Pimen’s peculiar investment.
</p>
<p>After three years and six months Dionisi returned to Suzdal with papers from the Patriarch.
As an eye-witness, he knew every detail of Pimen’s ordination, and he explained all
to the Grand Prince. In that year, 1383, Dionisi was sent by Dmitri to Tsargrad to
secure the expulsion of Pimen. Later on Dionisi was ordained metropolitan, but on
the way home he was arrested in Kief, where he died three years later in prison. Pimen,
expelled from his office, and even deprived of communication, did not yield to Cyprian.
</p>
<p>In the midst of these troubles rose the terrible question of meeting the Mongols,
a question of salvation or ruin for Russia. Mamai had roused the whole Mongol power
to destroy Russia utterly. He intended to appear as a second Batu, to reconquer, then
rule as might please him. All of 1379 was spent by Mamai in preparation; no matter
how he strove to conceal these preparations, they became more and more evident. Moscow
spies at the Horde capital gave clear notice of all that was going on, and at last
Dmitri declared to his boyars and counselors: “Mamai is marching against us!”
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince had been greatly troubled by the coming war <span class="pageNum" id="pb380">[<a href="#pb380">380</a>]</span>and its perils, but he became cheerful and resolute when all doubt had vanished, and
he prepared for the trial with alacrity. The danger was great, for Oleg of Ryazan
and Yagello were assisting the Mongols. They had, in fact, formed an alliance with
Mamai. Toward the end of 1379, Dmitri mustered his warriors. He sent then to Michael
of Tver, called him brother, and asked for assistance. Michael deputed his relative,
a Holm prince, with his contingent; a Kashin prince came also, leading his men.
</p>
<p>Dmitri summoned forces from Pskoff and Novgorod. Novgorod hurried forward an excellent
quota. Pskoff sent word that it would take part in the struggle. The Nizni prince
furnished men from both sides of the Volga.
</p>
<p>In 1380 Mamai boasted that he had assembled half a million warriors. He had left the
Lower Don and was moving on Varony. Besides Mongol warriors, he had many hired troops
in his army, Turks and Armenians. One complete regiment was made up of Genoese from
Kaffa. Mamai, who wished to repeat the success of Batu, intended to cross the Don
River, and so march that Oleg and Yagello might join him and strengthen his forces
in season. He boasted tremendously. “We need supplies for the winter,” said he to
his Mongols. “We are going to eat Russian bread, and grow rich on Russian treasure.”
“Does Mitya,<a class="noteRef" id="xd32e3185src" href="#xd32e3185">1</a> my servant in Moscow, know that I am going to see him?” asked he, laughing, in presence
of some Russians. “With me are twelve hordes with three kingdoms, and thirty-three
princes, besides foreign leaders. We have seven hundred and three thousand warriors.
Can Mitya, my servant, entertain us all?”
</p>
<p>Oleg of Ryazan turned to the Mongol with these words: “To Mamai, the free Eastern
Grand Khan above Khans, I, thy appointed and sworn servant, pray thee. Thou art marching
to punish Dmitri, thy servitor. The time is near, Serene Khan, when thy hands will
hold all the riches of Moscow. Free me, thy slave, through thy grace from disaster.
Dmitri and I are thy slaves, but I am obedient and humble; I serve thee. Dmitri is
refractory and insolent.” Papers like these, seized by Dmitri’s swift horsemen, revealed
what his enemies were plotting.
</p>
<p>Interesting was Oleg’s correspondence with Yagello: “Grand Prince Yagello, I write
to thee gladly. Thou hast been thinking <span class="pageNum" id="pb381">[<a href="#pb381">381</a>]</span>this long time to punish Dmitri; the time has now come to do so. Mamai is marching
on Moscow with countless warriors. My envoys have gone to Mamai with many gifts and
with worship. Thou wilt send things of as much higher value as thou art above me in
greatness. When the Khan comes and Dmitri escapes to distant regions, we will sit
in Moscow or Vladimir. At the Khan’s command, we will divide Moscow between us; thou
from Lithuania, I from Ryazan.”
</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Mamai, while delighted with their offers of service, declared
to each of the princes as follows: “As much Russian land as ye wish in my dominion
I will give as reward, and ye will utter strong oath to me.” And then, with Mongol
haughtiness, he added: “I do not need your assistance, but since ye have been abused
I reward, and show you favor.” He informed them suggestively that he considered the
campaign against Moscow as undertaken only to punish disobedience. “The terror of
me will crush Moscow,” said he, as if to chide them for exalting his glory in the
triumph then approaching. For invincible majesty like his, it was no exploit to quell
Dmitri.
</p>
<p>When the summer of 1380 began, Yagello set out to join Mamai. News came to Moscow
in season. Swift couriers hastened in many directions. All were anxious, all were
impatient. Each man sent out seemed to go at a snail’s pace. Soon reports were confirmed
by the statement: “Mamai is coming!” Meanwhile, regiment after regiment was appearing
at Moscow, and marching on farther toward Kolomna. Somewhat later news came that Mamai
had halted, or was moving more slowly; that he was waiting for his allies. He and
Yagello had agreed to meet at the Oká, and enter Moscow regions in early September.
All of Dmitri’s men were to be at Kolomna before the first half of August had ended.
</p>
<p>As there was no metropolitan at that time in Moscow, Dmitri went to the Troitski abbot,
Sergai, for a blessing. He shared his food with the holy hermit, and noting among
the monks present two of great strength and stature, by name Peresvait and Oslyaba,
he asked as a favor that they should go with him. In the world they had been boyars,
and noteworthy persons. At parting, Sergai gave this comfort in words to Dmitri: “The
Lord will defend, He will help thee. He will put down thy enemies and give thee great
glory.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb382">[<a href="#pb382">382</a>]</span></p>
<p>August 20, Dmitri left Moscow and found his whole army waiting at Kolomna. There was
a general review at that place, and a redistribution of parts of the army. When everything
was in order, prayer was offered up in the open field, and then all the army sang
“<i lang="ru-Latn">Spasi Gospodi pyudi Tvoya</i>” (O Lord, save Thy people). It may be that never had the strength and great meaning
of these words been felt more profoundly in Russia than in Kolomna on that day.
</p>
<p>The army was divided into the center, the left and the right wing, the rear and the
vanguard, each of which divisions was again subdivided in the same way. Dmitri was
in the center with his chief voevodas. Among the first of these was Bobrok of Volynia,
to whom the most difficult work in that march had been given. The next famed voevodas
were Mikula and Nikolai Velyaminoff. On the right wing marched Vladimir, Dmitri’s
cousin; the left wing was led by Glaib, among the most beloved of the leaders, a prince
from Bryansk, whose name his friends had changed to Brenko. When all places were assigned,
the army advanced toward the Don, marching so as to intercept the advance of Yagello.
</p>
<p>As soon as the army had moved from Kolomna, scouting parties were sent out on all
sides to learn clearly the positions of Mamai, Yagello and Oleg. In the first days
of September, the army reached the Don country, and on September 6, 1380, Dmitri’s
men beheld the brown river. They encamped directly in front of that spot where the
small river Nepryadva enters the Don. Some of the voevodas were in favor of waiting
for the Mongols without crossing the river, but in this case Dmitri showed resolve
and immense firmness. He wished to cross the river and give Mamai battle immediately.
When all opposing reasons were given, he answered: “I have not come to the Don to
watch Mongols.” Just then one of the two monks who had come with him from the Troitski
monastery gave him a letter from the abbot, which contained these words, and seemed
to Dmitri to point out the true order of action: “March on, O Prince Dmitri, Our Lord
the Holy Trinity will assist thee.”
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Mongol prisoner had been brought in from Mamai’s outpost; not a simple
warrior, but a man who, because he feared torture, gave true information. “The Khan
is waiting,” said he, “for Oleg of Ryazan, and Yagello. He does not know <span class="pageNum" id="pb383">[<a href="#pb383">383</a>]</span>that the Moscow prince has reached the Don.” To the question “Is his force great?”
the man answered: “An immense multitude; it is countless.”
</p>
<p>From the west now came tidings that Yagello was at Odoeff. Again the question rose—“Shall
we cross the river, or wait here for the enemy?” “It is better to cross,” declared
some. “We shall bring fear to Mamai’s men.” Others objected. “Wait on this side,”
said they, “it is safer. Mamai is mighty; to attack him may ruin us.” But the first
men insisted that the blow should be given before Yagello could join with the Mongols,
and they instanced how Nevski had beaten the Swedes by crossing a river, and how Yaroslav
the Lawgiver, by passing the Dnieper, had crushed Sviatopolk the Cursed. “If we stay
here,” added Andrei and Dmitri, Yagello’s two brothers, “we shall give a weak battle;
if we cross each man will think, ‘We cannot escape, we must win, though we die in
the struggle.’ The Mongols may be many, but are we not Orthodox Christians? God is
in truth, not in numbers.” “But if we leave Oleg in the rear?” asked others. “It is
better to withdraw to one side, intrench, and wait; see what Oleg will do. How can
we leave him behind us?”
</p>
<p>Dmitri rose then and began speaking: “I,” said he, “address no man apart, but speak
to all equally. I have not come to stand guard over Oleg, or to watch the Don River.
Better never leave home than come hither and do nothing.” He gave command then to
find fords and pass over immediately. “Dear friends and brothers,” said he, as he
rode through the regiments later, “we are preparing to cross the river. On the other
side we shall find that which God sends us. Either we shall win and redeem all, or
we shall lay down our lives for our brothers, Orthodox Christians.” “We are ready
to die or to conquer!” responded the whole army.
</p>
<p>Dmitri’s decision was timely and wise. Simeon Melik, his boyar, rushed in and declared
that he had been battling with outposts; that Mamai was at Gusin Brod and knew of
Dmitri’s arrival, that he was hastening on to prevent him from crossing, and thus
delay battle till after the coming of Yagello. It was learned that Yagello had marched
from Odoeff, and that Mamai was informed of his movements. There was no time for loitering;
on the contrary, moments might be decisive.
</p>
<p>September 7, Dmitri’s army was on the right bank of the river <span class="pageNum" id="pb384">[<a href="#pb384">384</a>]</span>A ford had been found near the Nepryadva, and when the moon, full on September 1,
touched the horizon, all the regiments had crossed and were encamped. The army extended
along the Nepryadva about three miles and a half, with its rear toward the river,
which had a steep bank, and was hidden by a forest. In front of the army was a wide
open region of gentle hillsides, and slightly raised flat land. That eve of the Holy
Virgin’s Nativity, September 7, O.S., was calm and warm, and the moon was shining
clearly. Just at midnight, when all the warriors were at rest, the Grand Prince and
Bobrok of Volynia rode out to examine the battle-field. When out a good distance they
looked around at their sleeping army, that host of two hundred thousand men. Here
and there they could see the dying flame of a camp-fire; farther off at one side,
or behind them, were numberless distant lights of small watch-fires. From the Nepryadva
and the Don came at intervals the cry of a night-bird, or the plashing of wings on
the water; and from the forest the howling of wolves was heard, or the screech of
an owl, as if the odor of flesh had enticed them.
</p>
<p>Bobrok, who knew well the tricks of war, and their practice, learned in countless
expeditions and battles, showed Dmitri how to estimate the enemy’s strength and position
by the “earth throbbing,” as people called it in those days. Both men dismounted,
put their ears to the earth, and listened. They heard a sound from tens of thousands
of horses, a sound as if myriads of people were building a city, or as if an army
of men had met, on a great boundless market-square, in discussion. The coming day
seemed mysterious, ominous, from this deep “earth throbbing.” Bobrok, however, gave
hope to Dmitri, and as he had faith in his own heart, he assured the Grand Prince
of triumph, but triumph which would verge very closely on failure. “Thou wilt overcome
the Mongols,” said he, “but many and many of thy faithful men will fall by pagan hands.”
“God’s will be done,” replied Dmitri, sadly.
</p>
<p>After they had examined the battle-ground carefully, they returned without speaking.
The broad field of Kulikovo was cut in two by a depression, at the bottom of which
flowed the small Smolka River. Near its mouth stood a dense forest, but its farther
extent and all the upper part of the depression was composed of level eminences, the
gentle slopes from each facing another. On <span class="pageNum" id="pb385">[<a href="#pb385">385</a>]</span>the high field touched by the Nepryadva the Russian army had arranged itself. From
beyond the elevation, which faced the army, the Mongols were expected. Toward this
elevation stretched from the steep bank of the Nepryadva another depression containing
a forest of oak trees. This was the Lower Dubik, at the bottom of which was a small
stream, also called Dubik, which flowed into the Nepryadva. The beginning of this
Dubik depression began far beyond Kulikovo, but when it approached the Nepryadva it
branched off in the flat expanse into small side slopes, which, becoming less marked,
ceased at last near the foot of that eminence beyond which began the gentle slopes
toward the Smolka. That was therefore the highest place in all the eminence. It was
clear that on that place the Mongols would camp; from that point they would move to
the battle. In general the position seemed favorable to Dmitri.
</p>
<p>The well known tactics of the Mongols of spreading out widely and enclosing the enemy,
which they did through numerical preponderance, could not be used by Mamai at Kulikovo.
He could not turn either flank or reach the rear of the Russians. The abrupt bank
of the Smolka, on which rested the left wing of the army, seemed unapproachable, through
its woody entanglement, for some distance before it reached the Don, and the right
wing rested on the rugged bank of the Nepryadva, which had no ford at any point. Besides,
the descent from the eminence to be occupied by the Mongols to the center of the plain
of Kulikovo was to some extent difficult. The great point was to give Mamai no time
to make plans after coming, and for the Russians to advance as far from the Don as
was needed, and quickly. The Mongol cavalry would be confused from lack of room to
develop. It is true that in case of defeat the destruction of the Russians seemed
certain. Escape would be cut off on three sides, and advance would be blocked by the
enemy. But the army had crossed, so that no man might think of retreating. The forest
which covered the lower course of the Smolka gave also the chance of secreting a division
of warriors to meet the Mongols, in case they should try to encircle the rear; or,
if they should force the Russian center and cut it in two, this division would meet
them. In view of this plan, the various parts of the army were assigned to positions.
</p>
<p>On September 8, the Virgin’s Nativity,—when day and night <span class="pageNum" id="pb386">[<a href="#pb386">386</a>]</span>are of equal length, the sun rising at six and setting at the same hour in the evening,—the
whole country was covered with a dense fog. Time passed, and still the sky was not
visible. Meanwhile the regiments were taking their positions. The men under Bobrok
and Vladimir the Brave took a place on the left wing. To them were added Novgorod
forces commanded by Dmitri of Nizni. He was to stay on that wing and not leave it,
but Bobrok and Vladimir, after the battle began, were to enter the forest and wait
till Bobrok gave the signal for action. The right wing, which touched the Nepryadva,
was commanded by Andrei and Dmitri, sons of Olgerd. To their forces were joined the
Pskoff and Starodub men, with Rostoff troops and others. The Grand Prince took his
place in the center, made up of warriors from Moscow, Vladimir and Suzdal. This was
the great, the strong regiment, divided again into portions. Its left flank, which
touched on the Nizni men, was commanded by Bailozero princes; its advance lines were
led by Nikolai, and the center by Timofei Velyaminoff with Prince Glaib, known as
Brenko. The right flank, which touched on the forces of Andrei and Dmitri, was commanded
by other great boyars.
</p>
<p>About an hour before midday the fog disappeared, and the day became radiant. The Grand
Prince rode through the regiments, encouraging all to have firm faith in God, and
stand steadfast for Christ’s sacred Church, and the whole Russian land. “We are ready
to die or win!” was the answer. The eagerness for action grew irrepressible, as the
murmur spread over those two hundred thousand men: “The Mongols are coming! the Mongols!”
The Grand Prince rushed to his regiment, and with the words: “God is our refuge and
strength,” the army began to move forward. The awe of the moment filled every man.
Each wished to surpass every other in valor. There was no chance then for speaking;
all voices were merged in the thunder of marching.
</p>
<p>The Mongols, who appeared an hour before midday, did not stay on the height, as had
been their purpose. Urged to action by the rapid approach of the Russians, Mamai’s
legions rolled down like a flood to the field of Kulikovo. As they drew near the Russians
a Mongol champion of great size and threatening aspect rode out in front of the army,
and challenged any one to meet him. Hearing these words a man on the Russian side
turned to those about him, saying: “Fathers and brothers, forgive me, the sinful.
Pray for <span class="pageNum" id="pb387">[<a href="#pb387">387</a>]</span>me, brother Oslyaba!” This was the monk Peresvait. When Mamai’s champion saw him,
he spurred on with all his might. The Russian urged his horse unsparingly, and the
two men struck each other squarely with their lances; both horses fell, but rose again.
The Mongol dropped to the earth and remained there. Peresvait was borne back to his
place alive, but he died soon after.
</p>
<p>Trumpets on both sides now sounded for action, and the great battle began. At midday
they were fighting breast to breast; face to face. Lances broke as if reeds; arrows
came as numerous as raindrops. Dust dimmed the sun; people fell like grass when scythes
are cutting. A horse was killed under Dmitri; he mounted another. Later he was seen
on foot, limping and wounded. After that no man beheld him till the battle was over.
</p>
<p>When the Russians began the struggle, they had the Dubik on the west and the Smolka
on the east at the left, and looked themselves toward the south. Bobrok and Vladimir
retired to the forest and hid there, as they had been commanded. On the left wing
from which they had withdrawn, was the Nizni prince. The Mongols moved at midday on
the center, where stood the Grand Prince’s standard. In the first ranks were the valiant
boyars, Simeon Melik and Nikolai Velyaminoff. The sun was in the face of the Russians;
the wind was against them. The Mongols had the sunlight on their shoulders; their
faces were shaded; the wind was on their side and helped them. The main force and
weight of the enemy was hurled at the “great regiment” in the center, rather more
towards its left flank. On the right wing it was easier for the Russians, despite
the superior and growing force of the enemy. Mamai’s tent, commanding the field, was
on the height called Red Hill (Krasno Gora); from there he followed the battle, and
sent reinforcements, which rushed with great shouts to the places appointed; and for
miles in the width and the length of it the whole field of Kulikovo groaned with the
giant battle.
</p>
<p>The sound of the terrible conflict rose and fell from edge to edge of the land, like
deep bursts of thunder. No matter how the Mongols were cut down with swords, raised
on spears, or hewn with axes, they pressed into every place. Legion rushed in after
legion, numerous as in Batu’s day; a multitude so great that in places they were troubled
by their own immense numbers. At times they were so crowded, that, throwing away weapons,
they <span class="pageNum" id="pb388">[<a href="#pb388">388</a>]</span>fought empty-handed, and falling, were trampled. After a time, it seemed that the
Mongols were conquerors. Half the field on the left of the Russians appeared to be
won by Mamai’s men; but the Russians remembered how their ancestors had died on the
Kalka; and praying, “O God, do not suffer us to perish like our fathers on the Kalka,”
they sprang up again. “And it was a wonder,” said an eye-witness, “to see how those
thousands fought on the Kulikovo.” Each man tried to surpass the other. But the foe
was not second in valor. At two o’clock the battle was raging in all its fury and
its terror. Neither could conquer the other; attack and resistance were equal. Then
Mamai’s warriors stormed at the center, and, though driven back, rushed again to the
onset and displaced the left wing of the enemy.
</p>
<p>Mamai, from Krasno Gora, saw the Russian ranks weaken, saw that banners and flags
had gone down in great numbers, and he sent his last strong reserve forward. The left
wing was torn from the center. There remained but a few wretched remnants of the regiments
from Nizni, and the center itself held its place with terrible effort. Andrei, son
of Olgerd, had to send from the right wing part of his forces to strengthen the center,
now ready to separate into fragments. Passing around the rear, behind the men fighting
under Brenko, this reinforcement came out where the left wing had been forced from
the center, and the rent was repaired by its coming. The balance of the battle was
established. The Vladimir and Suzdal regiments had been brought to disorder, because
in their ranks were men without training, taken recently from the plough. These, thinking
that the end had come, were breaking. Now they rallied, and, under the valiant Timofei
Velyaminoff, they prevented the Mongols from winning. The struggle at that point had
grown desperate. The Mongols in their turn were thrown into disorder, and fell back
after suffering a pitiless slaughter. All on the Russian side were encouraged by this
new advantage, and they paid back the enemy with mighty strokes.
</p>
<p>Thus the battle raged on till three o’clock, when came the moment of greatest intensity.
Mamai, looking from his height, was quivering from excitement, anxiety, and anger.
Doubt in the power at his disposal was beginning to seize him, when all at once an
immense shout of joy was sent up by the Mongols. The center had been displaced by
Mamai’s men. Toward the Don the Russian <span class="pageNum" id="pb389">[<a href="#pb389">389</a>]</span>line had given away very sensibly. The right Russian wing kept its position from the
height, the left wing could not be discovered; only Mongol troops were visible on
that part of the field. Simeon Melik and Nikolai Velyaminoff were both dead. The “great
regiment” was almost annihilated.
</p>
<p>After shattering Timofei Velyaminoff and Brenko forces, the Mongols turned toward
the left wing, They found little resistance there from the forces of the Bailozero
princes, and still less from those of Dmitri of Nizni. Thus the whole Russian left
and center were pushed more and more from their original positions by the enemy, and
driven toward the Don.
</p>
<p>The right wing had suffered less from the Mongols,—even had the advantage.
</p>
<p>The sons of Olgerd not only repulsed the extreme Mongol left, but advanced on it.
They were held back, however, by the fact that the center could not advance with them.
The entire center was overborne and pushed back by the immense force of Mongols, but
still it did not let itself be broken. Then Pskoff troops and others were sent to
support the left wing. The two sons of Olgerd repelled every onset from horsemen,
till at last, though not moving forward, they found themselves in advance of all other
forces. At four after midday, the great standard of the Grand Prince went down, and
nearly at the same time Brenko died. Judging by his dress, the Mongols took him for
the Grand Prince, and shouts of triumph filled all the battle-field. The princes of
Bailozero had fallen. There also, among the piles of dead, lay the two princes Tarusski,
and many others. But the struggling army made the enemy pay dearly for every step
they gained; they fought breast to breast, and retreated, it might be said, advancing
one step and falling back two, to advance then another step. The field was covered
with bodies, the body of a Russian on the body of a Mongol. The Russian power was
failing, yielding, falling back,—on the point of breaking.
</p>
<p>Mamai was triumphant. From the height of Red Hill the left wing and the center of
the Russian army seemed broken into fragments.
</p>
<p>All this was seen by Vladimir and Bobrok of Volynia from their ambush. “Why are we
idle so long?” asked Vladimir, reproaching Bobrok, and eager to rush into action.
Bobrok restrained him, <span class="pageNum" id="pb390">[<a href="#pb390">390</a>]</span>and followed every movement with the utmost care and anxiety. Men sent by him to watch
from the tree-tops gave details. “Wait, wait a little longer,” said Bobrok. Meanwhile
the turn made by the Russians was so great that, facing them always, the Mongols came
at last to present their rear ranks to the regiments in ambush, while the Russian
left wing was almost where it had stood at the opening of the battle. The right wing
had repulsed all attacks and remained in its original position. The men in ambush
were enraged at Bobrok. “Why are we here? What are we doing?” “Why do we wait to see
our comrades slaughtered?” “If we begin at the wrong time,” said Bobrok, “all will
be lost.” When at last he saw that the moment had come, he said: “Pray to the Lord
now, my brothers. This is the moment!”
</p>
<p>All made the sign of the cross and rushed forward. The regiment appeared like a terrible
storm in the midst of the battle. Those warriors had sprung, as it were, from the
earth behind the enemy. Strong, fresh and eager for hours to join in the action, directed
by heroes like Bobrok and Vladimir, they decided the battle.
</p>
<p>Wearied as they had been, though upheld by the flush and glory of triumph, the terror
of the Mongols became now in one moment unbounded. Struck in the rear and the flank
by fresh warriors, they were in a hopeless position. Every Mongol who had strength
to leave the field fled. The left and right wings of the Russian forces, under Dmitri
of Nizni and the sons of Olgerd, rushed after the fugitives. The defeat and the ruin
of Mamai’s men was complete. He and his magnates fled, leaving all things behind them.
Bobrok’s fresh troops followed throughout the night. The rest of the army, which was
wearied, held the field of that desperate slaughter.
</p>
<p>Vladimir left pursuit to Bobrok, and returned. His one question was: “Where is the
Grand Prince; where is my cousin Dmitri?” No one could answer. “Look for him! Look
for him!” cried Vladimir. They sought him in all places, and at last two warriors
found him not far from where the battle had opened. There were many trees freshly
felled in that place. Among the branches of one of these trees, they saw, as they
thought, a dead body. On examination they found that the man was breathing, and then
they recognized the Grand Prince. One of the men remained with him, while the other
rushed with the news to Vladimir. <span class="pageNum" id="pb391">[<a href="#pb391">391</a>]</span>Dmitri was bruised and injured internally, and though he recovered his life was cut
short by the wounds received in that terrible battle.
</p>
<p>Five centuries have passed since that memorable day, but the name of Dmitri of the
Don is still fresh in the minds of the people, and on “Dmitri’s Saturday,” the anniversary
of the battle, prayers are offered by the Church in remembrance of the men who on
the field of Kulikovo laid down their lives for fatherland and faith.
</p>
<p>The victory gave immense gain to Moscow. It strengthened that city’s supremacy greatly.
But the liberation of Russia from the Mongols was still in the future, and distant.
It was not till a century and four years later that final freedom was attained, in
the reign of Dmitri’s great-grandson, Ivan Veliki.

<h2 class="main">SIEGE OF MOSCOW</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mamai fled from Kulikovo and assembled a fresh and numerous army to take revenge on
Dmitri for his triumph. But suddenly a new enemy rose up against him: Tohtamish, made
Khan only recently by Tamerlane, declared himself heir of Batu, and set out from the
Yaik River to take possession of his inheritance. Mamai marched forth to meet him,
and on that renowned field near the Kalka, the field where Mystislav the Gallant had
been vanquished, the Mongols met now to slaughter one another. Tohtamish triumphed.
Mamai’s perfidious murzars fell at the feet of the conqueror, and swore to serve him
faithfully all their lives. Mamai fled to Kaffa, the present Theodosia, taking with
him rich treasures. “He went with much gold, silver, jewels and pearls, and was slain
by the Genoese deceitfully.” They seized all his property, secure in the knowledge
that the death of Mamai would please the new Khan greatly. The position of the Genoese
was precarious in those days, and they strove always to please in every way possible
the Mongol Khan who was in power.
</p>
<p>Master now of the Golden Horde, Tohtamish sent envoys to Moscow and all other places,
stating that he had conquered Mamai, their common enemy, and had taken possession
of Sarai. The unexpected and uninvited guests were received nowhere with pleasure;
still they were entertained with honor and dismissed with presents and politeness;
but those things were not what the new Khan was seeking. He wished to see the Russians
just such slaves as they had been under Batu and Uzbek.
</p>
<p>In 1381, Tohtamish sent an envoy, Ak Hodja, with a suite of seven hundred, to Dmitri
to demand that all princes should visit him immediately. But when he reached Nizni,
the envoy dared not go farther. The Grand Prince had sent a message saying that he
could not answer for the safety of Ak Hodja or that of his suite, <span class="pageNum" id="pb393">[<a href="#pb393">393</a>]</span>should they continue their journey to Moscow. Ak Hodja then sent attendants to consult
with Dmitri, but even those, when they saw the resentment of Russians, did not venture
to enter the capital. Indignation against messengers bringing insolent demands from
men who had fled from the battle-field of Kulikovo was pardonable on the part of the
victors, but in the lofty answer of Dmitri was heard a note which had never been heard
from him earlier, and this note was not to the profit of Russia.
</p>
<p>After the victory at Kulikovo, Dmitri was so confident that he did not think it necessary
to assemble new forces, and be ready for battle. Trusting too much in Mongol weakness,
he turned his attention to home questions. Feeling the need of a metropolitan, it
was decided to summon Cyprian, who had been expelled from Moscow. An embassy was sent
to him, and on May 23, 1381, he returned, and was received in the city with great
solemnity. On that same day was announced the coming of Pimen, ordained at Tsargrad
in place of Mityai. But, as already stated, upon his arrival at Kolomna, he was arrested
and sent off to Chuhloma<span class="corr" id="xd32e3275" title="Not in source">.</span> Thus the Grand Prince passed the year occupied in home affairs, till news came on
a sudden that, in the land of the Bulgars, the Mongols had arrested Russian merchants,
had seized their boats, and in those boats they were now sending warriors toward Moscow.
</p>
<p>When Dmitri insulted and threatened Tohtamish’s envoy, serious work began at once
at the Horde. A daring campaign was planned and preparations were made in strict secrecy.
Tohtamish wished to surprise Moscow and capture it. Every man who could give news
to the capital was seized and held securely; strong pickets were stationed at all
points. Even reports could not go to Dmitri. At last, however, in spite of every precaution,
news reached Moscow, but too late to be of service. Dmitri learned of the terrible
power of his enemy only when many Russian princes had already joined Tohtamish.
</p>
<p>In this absence of union among princes lay the peril of Moscow. The great need was
to root out this remnant of a system of semi-independent princes, a system no longer
endurable, and unite the whole country. Moscow had done much in that direction, already.
The victory on the Don was proof of what Russia could do when princes were united.
But the more Dmitri gained, the less did other princes find in union their personal
profit, and profit <span class="pageNum" id="pb394">[<a href="#pb394">394</a>]</span>was all that most of them cared for at that time. They had helped to strengthen Moscow,
but they had no wish to raise the Moscow prince higher.
</p>
<p>Dmitri of Nizni, when he heard of the Tohtamish movement, sent his two sons very promptly
to the Horde with gifts, but the Khan was already on the road. By rushing after him
quickly, they came up to Tohtamish in Ryazan. Oleg, whose treachery in Mamai’s day
had been forgiven by the Grand Prince, now betrayed Moscow a second time. He went
out to meet the Khan, gave him many presents, offered to guide him in person, and
advised as to how to take the capital.
</p>
<p>Surprised now for the first time, Dmitri was discouraged. It was too late to find
troops. At first he thought to entrench himself near Kolomna, but, on summoning his
voevodas and available warriors, he discovered the astonishing weakness of his army,
and, after consulting with his cousin, decided that with such troops he could do nothing
effective. Some advised sending gifts, and begging for mercy; others said that the
Khan was raging, that the only way was to stand sieges in cities, and wait till men
could be assembled from all points. The Grand Prince decided to visit Yaroslavl, Rostoff,
Kostroma, and find men there. Vladimir was to hurry to Volok and get warriors in those
parts.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Khan’s troops were rapidly approaching. In his army were Dmitri’s brothers-in-law;
Oleg of Ryazan was there also.
</p>
<p>In Kostroma the Grand Prince enrolled perhaps ten thousand men. From Novgorod no word
had come thus far. The Tver prince, instead of helping Dmitri, sent his son to the
Khan with gifts and homage. Many warriors in Dmitri’s regiments deserted; whole companies
went home of their own accord. There was a general paralysis. In Moscow, deserted
by the army and left without a leader, there was anarchy. All who were able hurried
out of the city, and then appeared vagrants and persons who in ordinary times were
not visible anywhere. The mob rang the bells and summoned the inhabitants to die in
defense of their city. The Grand Princess and her children left Moscow, as did the
metropolitan Cyprian. The people wished to keep the metropolitan with them, but, leaving
all things and every one, he escaped unobserved and unattended, and fled to the Tver
prince. The mob <span class="pageNum" id="pb395">[<a href="#pb395">395</a>]</span>was like a sea in a tempest; there was no hope of rescue from any side.
</p>
<p>All at once Prince Ostei appeared in the capital with a small group of warriors. The
crowd did not know well who this prince was, or whence he came. Some declared him
a son of Oleg; but in every case they were delighted, for it was clear that he knew
well the art of war. There was more order after his coming. A great number of people
assembled from the environs, and Ostei, before shutting the gates of the Kremlin,
admitted all who would enter. The main defenders, however, were a rabble, the lowest
of the city, and a few merchants, abbots, priests, monks and deacons, men of all ages,
and women, some even with infants.
</p>
<p>August 15, 1382, the smoke and the light of distant burning announced the approach
of Tohtamish and his forces. On August 22 he was near the city and sent his advance-guard
to strike at the Kremlin. The Mongols examined the ramparts, rode around the walls,
estimated the depth of the moats, and looked at points whence attack might be possible.
Approaching the gates, they shouted: “Is the Grand Prince in Moscow?” They received
no answer, and toward evening they vanished. Next morning the Khan came himself and
laid siege to the Kremlin.
</p>
<p>The nondescript mob in the city robbed, drank, and rioted. Prince Ostei, who was defending
the fortress, was unable to repress the disorder; he was fighting on the walls and
greatly occupied. He met all assaults with success, and wherever the enemy tried to
carry a position he drove them back effectively. The Mongols had no wall-breaking
engines. For three days Tohtamish was baffled at every point. The fourth morning the
besieged were astounded,—it was silent and quiet in the camp of the enemy. Soon a
party of richly dressed warriors rode toward the Kremlin, princes of the Horde, with
a suite in large numbers. In front of all were the brothers-in-law of the Grand Prince,
Simeon and Vassili, sons of Dmitri of Nizni. The suite made signs that they came for
peace, and were allowed to ride up to the defenses. “The Khan wishes to show his people
grace,” said they. “He has come not against you, who are guilty of nothing. Our sovereign
has not come to strike you, but Dmitri. He is not angry with you,—ye are worthy of
favor. He only asks you to come out with small gifts and show honor; he desires nothing
further.” The same <span class="pageNum" id="pb396">[<a href="#pb396">396</a>]</span>words were repeated by Dmitri’s two brothers-in-law, whom the Khan had sent also to
parley. These Nizni princes declared that Tohtamish had sworn to harm no one, and
to take nothing save that which was given him with honor. Simeon seized the cross
from his neck and kissed it to prove his sincerity.
</p>
<p>Prince Ostei and all who had wisdom believed not, but many, even of those who seemed
wise, were pleased at this way of ending the struggle. The mob, from being warlike,
called for peace, and opposed Prince Ostei, the commander. “He alone,” said they,
“keeps up this struggle; we must stop it.” The prince turned to the best of the people
with these words: “Wait only a little; the Grand Prince and his cousin are coming
with reinforcements. The Khan has only a small army; ye must not believe those two
princes from Nizni. Above all put no trust in the words of Tohtamish; his promises
are worthless.” But the mob would not listen. From the walls they made the Horde princes
take oath to harm no one. The Nizni princes swore in the same sense a second time.
The clergy went out then with images and crosses. Prince Ostei, with the best of the
citizens, followed. Next came a great crowd of people with gifts, and with homage.
When the procession drew near the enemy’s camp, sabres flashed up on all sides. The
Mongols snatched the holy images and crosses from the clergy, threw them on the ground
and trampled them; then they cut down priests and people. The whole square in front
of the Kremlin was soon streaming with blood. Next they rushed through the gates like
a torrent, and slew all inside the Kremlin. There was no place of refuge. Those who
fled to churches were slaughtered there. All were slain without distinction. Everything
of value was taken from the churches, and not one book escaped destruction. All the
wealth collected during long years of labor was lost in that one day of terror, August
26, 1382.
</p>
<p>Tohtamish feasted among the ruins of Moscow, and sent men in every direction, to Vladimir,
Pereyaslavl and other places, for plunder. The division which went to Volok was met
by Vladimir the Brave, who defeated it thoroughly, killing, it was said, six thousand
Mongols. When the remnant of those Mongols returned, Tohtamish recalled his plundering
parties, and withdrew to Sarai with immense booty, and a great crowd of captives.
On the way he burned Kolomna, and plundered Oleg’s lands unmercifully. <span class="pageNum" id="pb397">[<a href="#pb397">397</a>]</span>But through an envoy he sent thanks to Dmitri of Nizni for sending his sons as assistants.
</p>
<p>Moscow was filled with decaying corpses; people of every age and condition were lying
there dead, and every building was either burned to the earth, or in ruins. Twenty-four
thousand people were buried by Dmitri when he came back to his capital.
</p>
<p>The princes of Ryazan, Tver, and Nizni gained nothing by their disloyalty to the Grand
Prince. Oleg of Ryazan suffered heavily when the Khan was retiring from Moscow, and
Dmitri, who had forgiven Oleg’s perfidy in Mamai’s day, now made him pay dearly for
aiding the men who burned the capital.
</p>
<p>As reward to the Nizni prince, Tohtamish gave the grand patent and returned to him
his son Simeon; but he gave him no help to win Vladimir, and retained Vassili, the
second son, as hostage.
</p>
<p>When Michael of Tver and his son went to the Horde with rich gifts, the Khan’s intimates
promised every aid, but time passed while Michael spent much and gained nothing save
promises. The metropolitan, Cyprian, favored Michael, and would not return to Moscow,
though two boyars were sent to conduct him; as a result of this disobedience he was
banished a second time in favor of Pimen.
</p>
<p>Upon Dmitri’s return to Moscow, he called back the people who had fled to other places
to save themselves and rebuilt the city with energy. He was at a loss as to how to
treat Mamai’s successor, when Tohtamish himself settled the problem. The Khan, seeing
that Dmitri was not prepared to visit Sarai, or send boyars with his homage, despatched
a gracious embassy to Moscow, while the city was still in ruins. Men knew at the capital
that Tohtamish had sent the Nizni prince a patent to the Grand Principality. It was
known also that Michael of Tver had tried, through much gold and silver, to get the
same patent, with the addition of Novgorod, but Karatch, the Khan’s envoy, declared
to Dmitri that Tohtamish would not displace him; he had satisfied his anger, and the
past was forgotten. They gave good presents to the envoy who had come with this information,
and conducted him homeward with honor.
</p>
<p>In 1383 the Grand Prince, no matter how grievous it might be, had to show the Khan
honor by sending his heir, Vassili, a boy of twelve years of age, to give homage.
Important boyars went <span class="pageNum" id="pb398">[<a href="#pb398">398</a>]</span>with him. Michael of Tver was then at the Horde, negotiating for the patent. He had
more wealth than the Moscow prince, but Dmitri’s boyars referred to previous charters,
especially that of Chanibek, who had confirmed the Moscow primacy forever, and then
they showed the original document. Tohtamish, who rested his own claims on regular
descent, and wished to honor his ancestor in order to strengthen his own power with
the past of the Golden Horde, gave Dmitri the charter.
</p>
<p>Michael of Tver, greatly grieved and disappointed, left the Horde, complaining specially
against that Mongol prince, who had promised him success beyond peradventure. “I know
my possessions,” said Tohtamish, while dismissing him. “All the Russian princes are
living on land which belongs to me. Let each live on that which falls to him by usage.
If he serves me with truth, I will reward him. Dmitri offended me, I punished him;
he serves me now truthfully, hence I reward him. Do thou go to Tver, and serve there
as is proper; thee also will I reward in time.” The Khan dismissed Michael, but kept
Michael’s son as a hostage.
</p>
<p>The evil rule of the new Khan was distinguished for uncertainty: Tamerlane had given
the throne to him, but once in power, Tohtamish, wishing to be independent, dared
to measure forces with that great conqueror. He raised his hand against his protector
and invaded Samarkand, Tamerlane’s capital; next he attacked Persian regions and found
there a terrible answer. He received blow after blow, one more deadly than the other,
from the great Mongol, who had conquered a large part of Asia. At last the final blow
struck him. These campaigns, with the dread of his master and the preparations to
ward off invasions, drew away Tohtamish, whose absences from Sarai were protracted
and frequent. At times it seemed as if Mongol power in Russia had ended, and then
Dmitri’s authority appeared in its vigor. But that was in the last period of Tohtamish’s
reign.
</p>
<p>Subjection to Tohtamish was at first very grievous; it recalled the worst days of
Uzbek’s reign. Vassili, the heir of the Grand Prince, sent to the Horde to render
homage, was detained most ungraciously for more than two years. Again Russian princes
went to get patents, and complain one against another.
</p>
<p>In 1383 the Nizni prince died, and no matter how Simeon and Vassili strove for their
father’s inheritance, the Khan, not wishing <span class="pageNum" id="pb399">[<a href="#pb399">399</a>]</span>to offend Boris, their uncle, gave Nizni to him, and to them he left Suzdal; but one
of the brothers, Vassili, he kept at the Horde as a hostage. A quarrel rose now between
the uncle and his nephews, and the nephews turned to Dmitri of Moscow to help them.
Since Nizni had been considered as connected with Moscow, Dmitri might not wish his
brothers-in-law to win Nizni, as they had not scrupled to help Tohtamish; still it
would be easier to get Nizni from them than from their uncle. Therefore, in 1387,
the Grand Prince assisted them to Nizni. Boris, who had suffered much in struggling
with Moscow, said then to his nephews: “My dear children, I weep now because of you;
later on you will weep because of another,” hinting thus at future absorption of Nizni
by Moscow. The brothers got Nizni at the price of subjection to Moscow, which after
that held Nizni as its own land forever. Thus, after a period, Dmitri again paid small
respect to the Mongols.
</p>
<p>In 1385, Oleg of Ryazan prepared to avenge on Dmitri the blow which the latter had
dealt him because of aid given the Horde in their conflict with Moscow. He seized
Kolomna, and, following this seizure, a bloody war broke out between the two princes.
Vladimir the Brave led the army of Moscow. The Ryazan prince suffered heavily, but
so did Dmitri. One battle especially was noted for stubbornness; many of the best
men on both sides were slain. Dmitri offered peace, but Oleg was haughty; no matter
what offers were made, he was insolent. The Grand Prince, who had grieved much under
Mongol subjection, was crushed by the endless strife among princes, so he sent to
the Troitski monastery, and begged holy Sergai to visit Oleg on a mission.
</p>
<p>Sergai was revered throughout Russia and famed, as the chronicler tells us, for gifts
from the Holy Spirit. He so discoursed with Oleg that he changed all his venom to
kindness, and made final peace between the two princes. After that there was no war
either between Oleg and Dmitri, or between their descendants. This same year, 1385,
Dmitri had a son christened Peter, and Sergai was his godfather.
</p>
<p>The following year Feodor, son of Oleg, married Sophia, a daughter of the Grand Prince.
Dmitri’s next act was to bring Novgorod to reason. Counting on the weakness of Moscow
after the war with Oleg, Novgorod neglected all obligations, and it was only after
an attack on the city, in which many princes assisted, <span class="pageNum" id="pb400">[<a href="#pb400">400</a>]</span>that Dmitri maintained his position. Novgorod then paid its dues and signed a new
treaty.
</p>
<p>After his son had been absent nearly three years at Sarai, Dmitri obtained the Khan’s
consent to his return. Freed at last from detention, the young prince hurried off
with great gladness. Before returning to Moscow, however, he passed a year in Romania
and Western Russia. He went then to Lutsk on a visit to Vitold, in whose daughter,
Sophia, he saw a young woman who charmed him. Vitold’s mother, the priestess Biruta,
was famous for beauty, and had enchanted Keistut, Vitold’s father. Biruta’s beauty
may have been reflected in her granddaughter. Anna, Vitold’s wife, who had saved him
from prison and death, might also have added her quota of comeliness. Sophia, in every
case, was a beautiful girl. Dmitri sent boyars to accompany Vassili on his journey
home, and charged them to bring Vitold to friendship. In this they succeeded, and
Vassili left Lutsk as the betrothed of Sophia.
</p>
<p>The meeting of this youth with his father after four years of absence was joyous.
That was the time, as Dmitri had decided, to declare him his heir, the coming Grand
Prince.
</p>
<p>Among Dmitri’s many troubles the one which weighed him down always was that of succession.
By raising their principality to be the central land of all Russia, the sons and grandsons
of Kalitá had placed Moscow on a height unexampled, hence they looked on inheritance
very differently from others. Dmitri wished to fix primogeniture in his line. The
tendency to this came through favoring causes. Simeon the Proud, Kalitá’s son and
successor, was obeyed by Ivan and Andrei, his younger brothers, as if he had been
their own father. Simeon died without heirs; almost at the same time died Andrei,
so when Ivan reigned in Moscow, after Simeon, he had no brothers. At Ivan’s death
he was succeeded by his one son, Dmitri, whose brother, Ivan, had died early, hence
there was only one descendant of Kalitá contemporary with Dmitri, his cousin Vladimir,
Andrei’s orphan. Vladimir, afterward surnamed the Brave, was Dmitri’s lifelong trusty
comrade. They were “one man,” as people said who knew them. Dmitri became Grand Prince
at twelve, but his cousin was younger. The pillars of the Moscow principality, the
guardians of Dmitri and Vladimir, fixed in a treaty the position of each prince to
the other. This treaty declared that Andrei’s father bound himself to serve <span class="pageNum" id="pb401">[<a href="#pb401">401</a>]</span>his elder brother without disobedience, to serve his principality with faith and fear.
Vladimir received only the possessions which had belonged to Andrei, his father, while
to Dmitri went all the rest, that is, what had belonged to his father, Ivan, and to
Simeon, his uncle. He reserved also the right in certain cases to execute Vladimir’s
boyars.
</p>
<p>About ten years later, when Dmitri was going to the Horde to reconcile the Khan with
Moscow, he made a will in favor of his own son, Vassili, born a few months earlier.
A new treaty was made then with Vladimir, who, to expressions of obedience to Dmitri,
added: “I am not to seek the Grand Principality against thee, or against thy children.”
This is a short line placed unobtrusively in a long list of settlements and properties;
but this line, almost unnoticeable among hundreds of names of villages and places
which formed the greater part of the document, is remarkable, especially through the
addition “or against thy children.” It is clear that the inheritance of the Moscow
throne from father to eldest son, not being in accord with ancient usage, was not
yet firmly established. Toward the end of Dmitri’s reign, this became the greatest
of all the cares which weighed on him. Living, as it were, in one family with his
cousin, a friend faithful and devoted, his only near relative, peerless for magnanimity,
a man who had “a golden heart,” as Dmitri himself declared with much emphasis, it
was all the more difficult to touch upon this very delicate question. It was possible
at first to avoid it, and for years say no word on the subject, but at last came the
hour when it was necessary to decide the great question: Who shall inherit the throne
on the death of Dmitri? If Vassili were heir, the new form of state, begun since Kalitá’s
day, would triumph. If Dmitri’s cousin, Vladimir, were heir, the ancient order would
win, to the ruin of all that Moscow had accomplished during five decades of dreadful
effort.
</p>
<p>Again the question might be considered as not very urgent, not demanding immediate
decision, for Dmitri was not yet forty years old, and was strong to all seeming; but
in fact he was feeble. He had no external wound, but he had never recovered completely
from the internal injuries received on the field of Kulikovo. Moreover, as his son
was about to marry, the question rose naturally: Was Vladimir, the cousin, to yield
seniority to Vassili?
<span class="pageNum" id="pb402">[<a href="#pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p>Would Prince Vladimir, who had been so magnanimous as to yield to Dmitri, yield now
and make Dmitri’s son his senior?
</p>
<p>Beyond doubt the trouble was more with Vladimir’s boyars than with Vladimir. Only
boyars of reduced princes yielded, and went to serve strong ones. The boyars of Vladimir
of Moscow, whose rights were undoubted according to the ancient rule of the country,
could not be yielding in this case. They defended their honor and profit together
with ancient legality in defending Vladimir; they were far more insistent than he
was. Consequently, the year of 1388 was beclouded by a quarrel between the Moscow
princes. Dmitri seized certain of Vladimir’s boyars, and sent them to places where
they were “kept under guard very firmly.” The honor of the boyars who defended his
position so faithfully was of course dear to Vladimir, and he had to take part with
them; hence rose a quarrel which grieved all the people.
</p>
<p>But at the beginning of 1389 the quarrel ended, and the friendship of the princes
was greater than ever. They made a new treaty and kissed the cross to observe it.
By this treaty Vladimir recognized the Grand Prince to be his elder brother as before,
and to be his father, and for himself and his children renounced every claim to the
headship of Moscow; yielding seniority to Dmitri’s heirs, and to all their sons with
them; recognizing Vassili, son of Dmitri, as his eldest brother, the second son, Yuri,
a brother of his age, and the younger sons as younger brothers, adding, besides, that
he would not seek the throne as against any of them. The Grand Prince, on his part,
called Vladimir not only his younger brother, as before, but his son. With such a
solemn declaration was the question decided, a question which for a short time had
disturbed the long harmony of the family.
</p>
<p>All glorified the magnanimity of Kalitá’s youngest grandson, who had done so much
for Moscow by helping to establish the first principle of inheritance from father
to eldest son.
</p>
<p>Two months had not passed after making the treaty, when Dmitri was a living man no
longer. Dmitri won glory at Kulikovo, and raised Moscow in popular esteem to a height
unattainable by other principalities. Dmitri, by careful insistence and management
in winning from Vladimir his renunciation of rights, and Vladimir, by yielding, established
single rule in Russia, which, without these two men, might never have been established.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb403">[<a href="#pb403">403</a>]</span></p>
<p>Vassili’s first act on succeeding his father was to send two noted boyars, Poleff
and Belevut, with attendants, for his bride, Vitold’s daughter, Sophia. Her father
had taken refuge at that time in Prussia, and was preparing for war with his cousin,
Yagello, who had killed Keistut, Vitold’s father. Vitold was seeking aid among the
Knights of the Cross against his cousin. It was pleasant for him, at that crisis in
his career, to receive envoys from the Grand Prince of Moscow. Sophia journeyed by
sea to Livonia, and thence through Pskoff and Novgorod to Moscow.
</p>
<p>Two years after his marriage, Vassili visited the Horde, and then, by agreement with
Tohtamish, united to Moscow the Nizni principality as well as Gorodets, Tarus, and
Murom. There was trouble with Novgorod, which caused bloodshed, but all was arranged
before 1395, when the second of the world-shaking Mongols came to punish Tohtamish
for his perfidy, and to give the entire Kipchak realm to the “ruinous wind of destruction,”
Tamerlane’s own words.
</p>
<p>No Khan after Tohtamish was able to restore power and unity to Kipchak. Batu and Uzbek
being the first and second, Tohtamish was the third powerful ruler of Kipchak. The
exalted estimate which the man made of himself caused the mortal struggle with Tamerlane,
to whom Tohtamish owed his dominion.
</p>
<p>A direct descendant of Jinghis, Tohtamish could not brook the lofty lordship of Tamerlane,
who was not descended from Jinghis, though he and that mighty ruler had a common great-grandfather.
Tohtamish affected to see in Tamerlane a second Mamai upstart, and in 1392 set out
to destroy him as he had destroyed Mamai. The motive for action was found in the taking
by Tamerlane of places east of the Caspian, but mainly Urgendj, a city on the Oxus
famed for its marvelous defense, the same city which had occasioned the quarrel between
Jinghis and his eldest son, Juchi, a quarrel which was never ended.
</p>
<p>Tohtamish began by attacking regions bordering on Kipchak, regions belonging to Tamerlane.
Tamerlane moved promptly from his capital and wintered near Tashkent, where he assembled
an immense army. During that year he moved northward toward the Tobola River, and,
turning to the west, reached the Yaik River May 29. He crossed at a place of which
Tohtamish was not thinking and, continuing the march, found the Khan at some <span class="pageNum" id="pb404">[<a href="#pb404">404</a>]</span>point near the Volga. Tohtamish had also assembled great forces. In his army were
Bulgars of the Kama, mountaineers of the Caucasus, Bashkirs and Russians.
</p>
<p>Though it was June the weather was severe, and snow fell for several days in succession.
At last, on the eighteenth, the sun broke through the clouds and the weather cleared.
Before battle Tamerlane, having arranged his warriors in seven divisions ready for
attack, prayed to God, prostrating himself three times. Then the army deployed to
the cry, “Allah akbar!” (God is great), and with the shout “Surun!” (charge), the
battle began. It was prolonged and stubborn beyond example, but the art of Jinghis,
notably improved by Tamerlane, also the great skill and luck of the latter, and the
quarrels and treachery of commanders of the other side, gained the day and brought
success to Tamerlane. Tohtamish fled across the Volga, while his scattered hordes
were hunted by the victor and few of his warriors escaped. Tamerlane camped on the
battle-field and gave thanks to God for the victory.
</p>
<p>The Golden Horde, though it survived this terrible defeat, never regained its former
strength. Tamerlane plundered the country and went home, taking legions of captives,
with cattle, and treasures of all kinds. But the end was not yet. Tohtamish returned
to his capital and ruled there. He brought the whole Horde back to order. Three years
passed. Tamerlane had fixed his camp on the southern side of the Caucasus, on the
banks of the Cyrus, and there he learned that Tohtamish was preparing for a new and
more serious encounter. Tamerlane thereupon sent a letter to Tohtamish in which he
asked if he had forgotten his last terrible defeat. He reminded him how he, Tamerlane,
always treated those kindly who treated him kindly, while he pursued with vengeance
those who were his enemies. He reminded him also of his own great success, which made
him indifferent whether he was at peace or at war with the Khan of the Golden Horde.
Then, marching forward promptly to find Tohtamish, Tamerlane passed through the Gates
of Derbend to the northern side of the mountains, where, to begin the campaign worthily,
he exterminated the Kaitaks, subjects of Tohtamish, and then advancing, met his rival
near the Terek.
</p>
<p>The position of Tohtamish was strong, and protected by wagons arranged in the form
of a barricade, but on Tamerlane’s approach <span class="pageNum" id="pb405">[<a href="#pb405">405</a>]</span>he abandoned it and retired. Tamerlane now crossed the Terek, and the armies faced
each other on the fourteenth of April; on the twenty-second the conflict began.
</p>
<p>This second battle showed that Tohtamish had not greatly overestimated his own power,
that he was almost the equal of his opponent. The main body of Tamerlane’s army was
commanded by his son, Muhammed Sultan, while he himself commanded twenty-seven companies
of picked warriors who formed a reserve. Tamerlane’s left wing was thrown into disorder
and his center forced back. When the son-in-law of Tohtamish advanced upon his right
wing, Tamerlane charged upon him at the head of his twenty-seven companies and drove
him back. But his men, following too far, were in turn driven back and their ranks
broken. Tamerlane would have been captured but for the aid of Nur ud din, who came
to his rescue with fifty warriors. The battle was furious, but at last a quick rally
in front and a rear attack on the Kipchaks saved the day, though very narrowly. The
Kipchak troops gave way and Tohtamish fled. On that field strewn with corpses, Tamerlane
knelt down and thanked Heaven for his triumph. Then to Nur ud din, who had rescued
him, he presented a magnificent horse, a robe of gold brocade, a jeweled girdle, and
a large sum of money.
</p>
<p>Tamerlane’s victory brought no rest to the enemy, however. This time he hunted Tohtamish
far toward the north, and ravaged all places, sending strong forces east as far as
the Volga, and west to the banks of the Dnieper. He reached Ryazan’s southern borders
and destroyed Eletsk, with its prince and people. Then the “Iron Limper,” as Russians
called Tamerlane, moved northward, destroying all within reach of his army. Vassili
of Moscow hurriedly assembled his forces, and, entrusting the capital to his father’s
cousin, Vladimir, led his own men to the Oká to confront the invader. He now wrote
to the metropolitan to bring from Vladimir to Moscow that image of the Mother of God,
which Andrei <span class="corr" id="xd32e3360" title="Source: Bogolybski">Bogolyubski</span> had borne with him from Vyshgorod to the northern country. With great honor and reverence
the image was brought. A procession of ecclesiastics and boyars met it on the Kutchkovo
Field outside Moscow, and it was placed in the Assumption Cathedral, where the people
prayed before it, repeating “Mother of God, save Russia!” To the influence of this
image was ascribed <span class="pageNum" id="pb406">[<a href="#pb406">406</a>]</span>the retreat of Tamerlane’s army, which took place August 26, at the hour when the
holy image was met by the people. We may suppose that the approach of autumn, and
the poverty of the country, ruined so often by Mongols, were not without influence
in saving the capital.
</p>
<p>Tamerlane, on his march, destroyed the rich city of Azoff, a meeting-place for Venetians
and Genoese, near the mouth of the Don. Afterward he moved southward, attacking mountain
tribes of the Caucasus as he passed them, till an uprising among Mongols at Astrakhan
recalled him. Though the season was winter, and the snow was deep on the country,
he marched very swiftly on Astrakhan, stormed the city and destroyed it. He robbed
and ruined Sarai, and then, advancing by the way of Derbend and Azerbaidjan, returned
to Samarkand, his own capital.
</p>
<p>These blows were so crushing and dreadful that the Golden Horde never recovered. Many
Russians thought that the end of Mongol rule was before them. But the end was not
yet, as was evident soon after. The first to experience this bitter truth was Vitold,
who had won against Yagello and was now the haughty ruler of Lithuania and Western
Russia. Tamerlane gave the Golden Horde to a son of Urus Khan, the former rival of
Tohtamish, but Edigai, who had been one of Tamerlane’s generals, assumed Mamai’s rôle,—the
creation of Khans and ruling through them. He set up now Timur Kutlui instead of the
man whom Tamerlane had appointed.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tohtamish, who had ruled the Golden Horde for twenty years, had taken refuge
with Vitold. Through Tohtamish, Tamerlane’s fallen rival, Vitold planned to control
the Golden Horde, and in that way win Moscow. The first step was to capture Sarai
for his protege. Envoys came at this juncture from Kutlui with the message: “Surrender
Tohtamish, my enemy! Tohtamish, once a great prince, but now a vile deserter. Such
is the fickleness of fortune.” Vitold refused, adding: “I myself will march on Kutlui.”
Hearing of this resolution, Yedviga, Queen of Poland, warned Vitold, stating that
through her power of prophecy she foresaw that great misfortune would overtake him.
But he would not heed her warning.
</p>
<p>The expedition undertaken by Vitold was made a holy struggle. Boniface IX, through
a bull to the clergy of Lithuania and Poland, <span class="pageNum" id="pb407">[<a href="#pb407">407</a>]</span>ordained a crusade against the infidel and gave indulgence to all who took part in
it. Vitold assembled a very strong army. With him were at least fifty princes of Lithuania
and Southern Russia. A number of Polish magnates joined also. Tohtamish went with
a considerable contingent of Mongols. Even the German Order sent perhaps five hundred
iron-clad warriors.
</p>
<p>In July, 1399, Vitold set out on his expedition. The fame of Kulikovo roused him,
it is said, beyond other considerations, and he hoped to eclipse Dmitri’s fame by
greater achievements. He crossed the Dnieper near Kief and vanished in the steppes.
Passing the Horol and the Sula, he halted at Varskla. On the opposite bank appeared
the Mongols led by Kutlui, who, seeing that his enemy was superior in numbers, began
to negotiate. To win time was his object, for he was waiting for Edigai with a second
Mongol army.
</p>
<p>“Why art thou marching on me when I have not touched thy possessions?” asked he of
Vitold. “The Lord has given me dominion over all. Pay me tribute and be my son,” replied
Vitold. The Khan promised tribute, but did not like to put Vitold’s name and seal
on his coinage; he asked three days to think over that question. Thus he seemed to
yield the main point, though in reality he did not. Meanwhile he gave Vitold many
presents, and continually sent him questions, through envoys. When the time had passed,
Edigai arrived with his army, and begged that Vitold come out to the opposite bank
for an interview. “Valiant prince,” said Edigai, “if Timur Kutlui wishes to be thy
son, since he is younger than thou, in thy turn be my son, since I am older than thou.
Therefore pay me tribute, and put my seal on thy money.”
</p>
<p>Enraged by deceit and ridicule, Vitold commanded the army to leave its camp, cross
the river, and give battle at once. The prudent Spytko of Melshtin tried to warn the
Grand Prince, and advised peace in view of Mongol preponderance, but his advice only
roused wrath. A certain Polish knight named Stchukovski said, with scorn: “If thou
art sorry to part with thy wealth and thy young wife, do not frighten those who are
ready to die on the field of battle.” “To-day I shall die with honor, but thou wilt
flee as a coward,” retorted Spytko. His words proved to be true, for death met him
soon, and Stchukovski was among the first of the fugitives.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb408">[<a href="#pb408">408</a>]</span></p>
<p>The battle began after midday on August 5, 1399. The Mongols raised such a dust that
no one could see them. Thus did they hide their movements. They closely surrounded
Vitold’s army, and even seized the horses from many before they could mount. Artillery,
then of recent invention, could not be used in that battle with profit. Notwithstanding
these disadvantages, Vitold was able to force back and confuse Edigai’s army. But
Kutlui rushed to the Lithuanian rear with a great force of cavalry, crushed all before
him and triumphed. Tohtamish was the first to flee, after him followed Vitold with
his boyars, and Sigismund, his brother.
</p>
<p>The defeat was thorough and irreparable. Many princes were slain or taken captive.
Among the dead were Yagello’s two brothers, Andrei and Dmitri, who had fought at Kulikovo.
Seventy princes and boyars of distinction were left on that battle-field. The whole
camp, its provisions, and all the cannon fell into the hands of the enemy. Kutlui
followed the fugitives, and ravaged the country as far as Lutsk. From there he turned
back to the steppe with as much wealth as he had means of carrying, and driving as
many captives as his men could manage.
</p>
<p>Kutlui died soon after this expedition, and Edigai put Kutlui’s brother, Shadibek,
on the throne at Sarai. Seven years later Tohtamish died in Siberia, slain, it is
said, by the hand of Edigai, his dire enemy.
</p>
<p>Vitold’s defeat on the Vorskla was important for Eastern Europe. The weakening of
Lithuania, even for a time, was a godsend to Moscow. Not without satisfaction might
the people there look on this struggle between the two deadly enemies of Russia. Tamerlane’s
war with Tohtamish and Vitold’s great conflict with Kutlui were vastly important,
and useful to Moscow and Russia. Many Smolensk people, weary of Vitold, wished to
recall their native prince, Yuri, son of Sviatoslav, who was living in Ryazan with
Oleg, his wife’s father, and in 1400 Yuri turned to his father-in-law with these words:
“My Smolensk friends have sent men saying that many desire me. Wilt thou give aid
now to win my inheritance?” Oleg consented, and in 1401 he appeared at Smolensk with
an army, and declared to the people: “If ye refuse Yuri, I will not stop till I capture
Smolensk, and destroy it.” A schism rose quickly. Some were for Vitold, and others
were against him. <span class="pageNum" id="pb409">[<a href="#pb409">409</a>]</span>Yuri’s party was the stronger, and in August the Smolensk gates were opened to him.
This prince then gave rein to his passion, and marked his return by killing Vitold’s
chief partisans.
</p>
<p>In the war which came later between Lithuania on one side and Smolensk with Ryazan
on the other, Vitold’s attempt to get possession of Smolensk was a failure. Oleg now
thought to regain from Lithuania certain seizures, and sent his son, Rodoslav, to
win the Bryansk principality, but Vitold despatched an army under Simeon, son of Olgerd,
his skilful cousin, and Rodoslav met an overwhelming defeat. Captured and put in prison,
he lay there until ransomed, three years later. This reverse killed Oleg, then an
old man. Yuri’s position changed straightway. Though Vitold laid siege to Smolensk
without taking it, and was forced to withdraw, he resolved to subdue the place. In
time many boyars, indignant at the cruelty of Yuri, grew friendly to Vitold.
</p>
<p>Yuri had no aid now from any power, and the city was divided. He went to Moscow and
begged Prince Vassili to defend him, as he promised obedience to Moscow. Vassili did
not refuse the request, but he made no immediate promise, for he had no wish to raise
arms against Vitold. Meanwhile Vitold, during Yuri’s absence, appeared at Smolensk,
and in the summer of 1404 boyars surrendered the city. Vitold also was terribly cruel,
slaying, and driving out of Smolensk all his powerful opponents, but as an adroit
politician, he attracted many people by privileges, and turned them from Yuri, who
now went to Novgorod, where they welcomed him, and gave him several towns to manage.
</p>
<p>It was clear that Vitold had recovered from the Vorskla disaster, and was aiming to
seize Pskoff and Novgorod. In 1405 he attacked Pskoff, took Koloje, slew many people,
and captured large numbers. Novgorod, as usual, was either late with assistance, or
refused to coöperate. Pskoff men turned then to Moscow, and Vassili, understanding
at last the great peril which threatened him from Vitold, broke peace with his father-in-law,
and sent men to war on Lithuania. In the course of three years, 1406, 1407, and 1408,
war between these two princes had an annual renewal. Three times did Vassili and Vitold
march against each other with large forces, but each time they stopped before decisive
battle, and withdrew after a truce was made. It is evident that this halting was <span class="pageNum" id="pb410">[<a href="#pb410">410</a>]</span>caused in part by their mutual relations, in part by the caution of each man in view
of the other.
</p>
<p>Their last meeting took place September, 1408, on the Ugra, which served as a boundary
between them. After they had been encamped face to face on opposite banks of the river
for several days, they made a peace by which the boundaries of their lands remained
as they were at that time. Later on, Vitold made no serious move against Pskoff or
even Novgorod. By this war, therefore, Moscow restrained Vitold in Eastern and Northern
Russia. The war had other results also. Many noted Lithuanians and Russians, from
one and another cause, were dissatisfied with Vitold, and went to join Moscow. Especially
numerous were the men from near southern districts of Chernigoff. Among them appeared
in 1408 the brother of the Polish king, Prince Svidrigello, son of Olgerd. Laying
claim as he did to Lithuania, he had no wish to be subordinate to Vitold. Vassili
was willing to welcome such an exile, and gave Svidrigello a number of towns to support
him. Such liberality to a stranger displeased Russian boyars, and later on they were
raging when Svidrigello, instead of defending Moscow against Edigai, fled meanly with
his numerous attendants, plundering the people as he traveled.
</p>
<p>Strange was the fate of Yuri, the last Smolensk prince. He did not remain long in
Novgorod, and when the break came between Vassili and Vitold he appeared in Moscow
a second time, with Prince Simeon of Vyazma. Vassili gave Yuri Torjok to support him.
Now his unrestrained temper brought the man to a crime of foul aspect. He flamed up
with passion for the wife of Prince Simeon. Meeting with strong resistance on her
part, he strove to use violence, and when she defended herself with a keen weapon,
he killed her. On that same day he killed her husband also. No matter how rude was
the period, or how much liberty princes sometimes allowed themselves, such disregard
of human and Christian rules roused indignation and rage in all men. Either expelled
by Vassili, or rushing away from Torjok of his own will, Yuri fled to the Horde, but
finding no refuge there, or in any place, he wandered some months, sick and weighed
down in spirit, till he hid himself at last with an abbot named Peter, in whose monastery
his life ended shortly afterward.
</p>
<p>Disorder and murder in the Horde encouraged the Grand Prince <span class="pageNum" id="pb411">[<a href="#pb411">411</a>]</span>of Moscow to think of complete independence. He honored the Mongols with moderate
gifts, and, under pretext of national poverty, almost ceased from paying tribute.
He did not visit the Horde in the time of Kutlui, or during Shadibek’s reign, which
continued for eight years. In his slow struggle with Vitold he had received from the
Khan some small forces, that was all. When Shadibek was dethroned, and Kutlui’s son,
Bulat Bey, was instated, Vassili not only did not visit this new Khan; he even showed
favor to some of his enemies, two of Tohtamish’s sons, of course with the wish to
keep up civil war and disorder among the Mongols.
</p>
<p>This clear and well-defined policy was connected with a change of advisers in Moscow.
Former boyars, the counselors and comrades of Dmitri, had either died, or lost influence.
Vassili was surrounded by younger assistants, men formed by impressions, and filled
with the fame of the battle of Kulikovo. They were ashamed to be subservient to the
Mongols; they despised Mongol influence. At the head of this party was Vassili’s great
favorite, Ivan, son of Feodor Koshka.
</p>
<p>The Golden Horde Khans had no thought at this time of yielding their hold upon Russia.
They were at all times domineering, and in this they were encouraged by the princes
of Tver, Ryazan and Suzdal, who continued to visit Sarai to obtain patents. Edigai
had helped Vassili against Vitold; he had even roused enmity between the two princes
to weaken them when peace was finally made, and now he resolved to show that Moscow
was really subject to the Horde. But both Russians and Mongols remembered Kulikovo,
and knew that war between Moscow and the Horde would be most serious, hence at Sarai
they resolved on a stealthy and treacherous policy.
</p>
<p>Edigai knew well that Moscow, keeping in mind the perfidy of Tohtamish, had in Sarai
well-paid agents, who would give information immediately should any evident move be
made toward invasion. He knew also that hostility between Vassili and Vitold was still
active, hence he sent an envoy to Moscow, declaring that Bulat, the Khan, was making
ready to punish Vitold for the harm <span class="corr" id="xd32e3402" title="Source: down">done</span> to Moscow. He asked only that Vassili should send a brother to Sarai, or a boyar
of distinction, with expressions of homage, to the Khan. Vassili, yielding to this
demand, sent a boyar named Yuri, who met Edigai marching rapidly on Moscow. <span class="pageNum" id="pb412">[<a href="#pb412">412</a>]</span>The boyar was seized and held strict captive, and no word of the approaching army
reached Vassili.
</p>
<p>This happened late in the autumn of 1408. The Mongols were nearing Moscow, when the
Grand Prince learned what was happening. As it was too late to make a stand against
the invader, Vassili took his princess and children to the North, beyond the Volga,
for safety. The defense of the capital he left to Vladimir, his father’s cousin, and
to Andrei and Peter, his brothers. To make the siege difficult, all houses outside
the walls were burned. December 1, the Mongol army was visible. Edigai, seeing the
success of his stratagem, robbed, burned, and plundered on every side. Pereyaslavl,
Rostoff, Dmitroff, Nizni and Gorodets were taken. Mongols raced over Russia, like
wolves during winter, and seized all that they could reach, including people, whom
they drove, leashed like dogs, to their camping grounds. Panic terror was again master
in Russia. Thirty thousand Mongols were sent to hunt down the Grand Prince, but they
could not discover him.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the old hero of Kulikovo, Dmitri’s cousin, Vladimir, defended Moscow. The
walls were strong and well mounted with new and old weapons. There were plenty of
defenders; hunger alone could reduce the capital. Edigai now sent to the Tver prince,
Ivan, son of that Michael who had fought so long against Moscow, and commanded him
to come with troops, cannon, and wall-breaking instruments. But this Tver prince would
not serve the enemy of Russia; he set out with an army, not over numerous, and marched
very slowly. He reached Klin, fell ill, as he asserted, and returned home, being unable
to go farther. Edigai summoned Moscow to surrender, declaring that he was ready to
stay before the walls through the winter, or till the city received him. But all at
once from Bulat, the Khan, came a courier imploring Edigai’s immediate presence. Bulat
had barely avoided dethronement from a rival. It was evident that few warriors had
been left in Sarai, no force sufficient to defend the place. Meanwhile the Mongols
learned that Vassili was marching from Kostroma with a large army.
</p>
<p>At this juncture Edigai had the wit to win something. He announced that for three
thousand rubles he would raise the siege, and leave Moscow. No one knew the situation,
hence the money was delivered, and Edigai hurried home to save Bulat from dethronement.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb413">[<a href="#pb413">413</a>]</span>An immense train of captives and much booty followed after him. This raid had caused
great loss to Russia. From the Don to Bailozero, and Galitch beyond the Volga, the
country had been ravaged.
</p>
<p>Edigai now sent a letter to Vassili, in which he recounted that prince’s many sins
against his sovereign: the Khan’s envoys had been insulted, as well as his merchants.
The prince had not visited the Horde or sent his relatives or boyars. “In other days
thou hadst men well inclined to us. Listen not to youths, and thou wilt not be ruined
through haughtiness. When attacked by princes of Lithuania, or Russia, thou art quick
to ask aid of us, and give no rest till we send it. Thou sayest that thy lands are
exhausted, that thou canst get no tribute. This is false. We have learned that from
two ploughs thou receivest one ruble; what dost thou do with that money? Live in the
old way, uninjured and faithful.”
</p>
<p>But even after receiving this message Vassili was unwilling to give tribute to the
Mongols; and he was right in view of the turmoil and trouble in Sarai. Only when Edigai
had been hunted from the Horde and the son of Tohtamish, Jelal ed din, the ally of
Vitold, and the protector of the Suzdal princes then fighting with Vassili, had taken
his place, did the Moscow prince decide at last on a visit to the Mongols, taking
with him rich gifts, and words of obedience. But during his stay at Sarai Jelal ed
din was dethroned, and murdered by Kerim Berda, his own brother, who straightway declared
himself an enemy of Vitold, and friendly to Vassili.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the new Khan was of those who had found asylum in Moscow, when wandering and
powerless. Still the formal relations of the principality to the Horde were those
of a tributary. Some time later Kerim Berda was dethroned by a brother, and the dance
of disorder continued.
</p>
<p>One among many results of Vitold’s defeat at the Vorskla was to strengthen the bonds
between Lithuania and Poland. Weakened by that defeat, Vitold had to lower his haughtiness,
and seek aid from Yagello against powerful neighbors, that is, Northeastern Russia,
the Golden Horde, and the German Order. In January, 1401, the two cousins met at Vilna,
and bound themselves to give mutual aid whenever needed. After this meeting the princes
and boyars of Lithuania and Western Russia agreed to aid the Polish <span class="pageNum" id="pb414">[<a href="#pb414">414</a>]</span>king. If Vitold died while Yagello was living, Yagello was to be chosen as their Grand
Prince. If Yagello died before Vitold, the Poles were to choose no king without Vitold’s
concurrence.
</p>
<p>Thus was accomplished, though not very strictly, the union of Lithuania with Poland,
promised by Yagello at his crowning. Vitold acknowledged himself to be only lifelong
vicegerent. There was no mention of a tribute, which had been demanded once by the
late Queen Yedviga, who affirmed that Lithuania and Russia were hers as a marriage
gift from Yagello. Owing to this union, Vitold now recovered completely from that
Vorskla disaster.
</p>
<p>Those two cousins, Yagello and Vitold, were remarkable men. Yagello gave away what
he had for a show and a glitter. Vitold was willing to give that which he must give
for help to win, what for him was the one prize, dominion; and when he had this dominion
he snatched back that which he had given to those who had helped him. Poland aided
Vitold in everything, with the intent of taking from him when the time came all that
he might win from others through Polish assistance, while he wished to keep all that
he gained, no matter how he acquired it. Vitold renewed his incursive advance upon
Eastern and Northern Russia, but the first weighty blow was reserved for that active
and dangerous neighbor, that unsparing foe of Lithuania and Poland, the Teutonic Order.
</p>
<p>The apparent cause for this collision was Jmud, which Vitold, when preparing to struggle
with Yagello so as to bring him to his side, had given to the Knights of the Cross
in return for their aid, and which had remained pagan after Lithuania itself had been
Catholicized through Yagello by contract. The Germans introduced Christianity with
fire and sword into Jmud, entering that region by two sides, Livonia and Russia. The
people met their attackers with reprisals and uprisings, with resistance of all kinds,
and begged their prince, Vitold, to help them. He meanwhile, through policy, avoided
a break with the Order, and sometimes even helped that same Order to crush his own
people. But he was waiting to choose the right moment to take back his inheritance.
</p>
<p>At this juncture there rose a dispute between the Order and Yagello, touching lands
called Neumarch, or New March, which belonged to Sigismund of Hungary. Later on Neumarch
was mortgaged to the Order by Sigismund, that Emperor famous for the evil of his friendship,
and the virtue of his enmity, renowned <span class="pageNum" id="pb415">[<a href="#pb415">415</a>]</span>also for the burning of John Huss after he had given him a safe-conduct, one of the
most infamous acts recorded in the history of any country. This land touched on Poland.
Its boundaries were disputed, and caused a Polish grievance. The Poles had another
and greater grievance: The Order had taken from them Pomerania on the Baltic. There
was hatred on both sides.
</p>
<p>The Order felt confident of victory, and beyond any doubt would have won it had Poland
been alone in the conflict. From 1393 till 1407 Konrad von Jungingen, the Grand Master,
a man who was pious and peace-loving, repressed all hostile movements. But the Order
grew weary of peace, and when Konrad died his cousin, Ulrich, who was as warlike as
Konrad had been peace-loving, was chosen Grand Master and war was inevitable. There
were many causes for conflict, but the overshadowing and great one was race ambition.
The Order felt confident of victory, and chose its moment for battle.
</p>
<p>July 15, 1410, the forces of the Order engaged those led by Vitold and Yagello at
Tannenberg, and there the Order met a merciless defeat, from which it never rose as
a military body. But, though utterly vanquished, the Order was able, with endurance
and management, to save Eastern Prussia to the Germans, and in Königsberg, the capital
of that Prussia, was crowned the first Prussian king, whose descendant is now the
Emperor of Germany.
</p>
<p>Poland, before the crowning of Yagello, had been on the verge of destruction from
the Order, which counted the Poles as sure victims, and included with them the Lithuanians.
By the union of Polish, Lithuanian, and Russian forces, German plans were baffled,
and Poland, after the victory at Tannenberg, rose high in European estimation. But
Yagello, through indecision, and because of Vitold’s plans, failed much in settling
with the Order. Instead of rushing straightway from the field of victory to Marienberg,
the stronghold of the Order, the Polish king appeared there only on the tenth day.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Heinrich von Plauen, Komtur of the Order, had led home the remnant of the
knightly army, and brought in provisions. He defended Marienberg valiantly. The siege
dragged on; disease struck the armies of Yagello and Vitold. Help was marching to
the Order from Germany and Livonia. Sigismund, just chosen Emperor, threatened war
openly. Vitold abandoned <span class="pageNum" id="pb416">[<a href="#pb416">416</a>]</span>the siege and left Marienberg, influenced, it was said, by cunning hints that by helping
Poland over much he would harm his own power and position. He was followed by Prince
Yanush of Mazovia, and Zemovit, his brother.
</p>
<p>At last Yagello raised the siege and marched away from the stronghold. Many Prussian
towns which had surrendered at first to Yagello returned now to the Order. War lasted
till the following year, and ended with the treaty of Torun (Thorn), by which the
Order retained almost all it had held previous to the battle. Jmud went, however,
to Vitold, and the land of Dabryn to Yagello, but the gains were not great if compared
with what they might have been.
</p>
<p>Close relations between Vitold’s lands and those of the Polish Crown continued because
of common danger from the Germans. The Order recovered considerably under its new
Master. It could fall back for support upon Germany, where Sigismund befriended it.
The greatest loss for the Order was Jmud, which divided Livonia from Prussia, and
thus hindered contact between the two parts of the Order. Jmud prevented the union
of Germanized lands on the Baltic. But a greater gain to the Poles was the act of
Horodlo.
</p>
<p>In October, 1413, Yagello, with Polish magnates, and Vitold, with Lithuanian and Russian
boyars, met at the Russian town, Horodlo. At that meeting an agreement was made touching
the lands under Vitold, and the land ruled by Yagello. The agreement of 1401 concerning
succession was repeated. Diets which touched both political divisions were assembled
at Lublin or Parchov. To effect a more intimate union, Russo-Lithuanian boyars received
the same rights as Polish nobles. They were associated with Polish families in heraldry.
Thus the voevoda of Vilna, Monivid, was associated with the Polish shield belonging
to Leliva. A Lithuanian prince or boyar received a shield which belonged to a Polish
stock. In addition, the rights of nobles in Poland, already exceptional, were extended
to nobles in Lithuania and Russia, but these nobles were to be Catholic in every case.
A number of great offices of the Polish kind were created. None but Catholics, however,
could hold them. Thus Polish predominance in the upper circles of Russia was established
directly. All heathen parts of Lithuania had been Catholicized by Yagello, but <span class="pageNum" id="pb417">[<a href="#pb417">417</a>]</span>in Russia both princes and people were Orthodox. Some Lithuanian princes were Catholic,
and some were Orthodox. But no man could enjoy those new rights, or hold a high office,
without becoming a Catholic.
</p>
<p>Thus the significance of the Grand Prince of Lithuania and Russia, and the Orthodox
Church was diminished, for no prince or noble could hold an office created at Horodlo,
or enjoy the rights of a noble of the Commonwealth, without being Catholic. In other
words, two social systems and two kinds of government were confronted at Horodlo,—the
Russo-Lithuanian on one side, and the Polish on the other. Vitold’s aim in church
matters was to rend the church union of Russia, to separate the western provinces
of Moscow. He wished that the metropolitan of all Russia should be resident in Kief,
where he himself was master, and have jurisdiction in Moscow. In case that could not
be effected, he wanted that Western Russia should have its own metropolitan. Hence
during the fourteenth century, more than once there were two metropolitans, one in
Moscow, another in Kief, and sometimes a third in Galitch. We have seen that Cyprian,
at first metropolitan in the West, outlived his Moscow opponents Mityai and Pimen,
and united the whole Church in Russia. Though he, like his predecessors, lived in
Moscow, still he preserved the friendship of Vitold and Yagello. He often visited
the West and remained for long periods; he consulted Yagello and Vitold, and generally
upheld the church unity of Russia, excepting Galitch, over which he had also some
influence. The last years of his life were passed mainly near Moscow, where he translated
several books, and wrote others. He died September 16, 1406.
</p>
<p>At that time there was actual collision between Vassili and Vitold; the latter, determined
to have a metropolitan in the lands under him, proposed Theodosia. The Patriarch failed
to accept this suggestion, and in 1408 appointed Foti, a Greek born in the Morea,
as Cyprian’s successor. Vitold was very angry, and, in view of Western displeasure
with Foti, decided to have a second metropolitan. His choice fell on Gregori Samblak,
who was, as some declared, a nephew of Cyprian.
</p>
<p>The Patriarch refused to confirm this division of Russia into two parts. Not getting
his consent, Vitold assembled a Synod in 1416, and, through kindness and threats,
secured the installation of <span class="pageNum" id="pb418">[<a href="#pb418">418</a>]</span>Samblak. But Samblak, being a zealous defender of Orthodox interests, remained only
three years in office. In 1419 he left Western Russia, and church unity was reëstablished.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Edigai, expelled from the capital of the Golden Horde, chose the Crimea
as a new field of action. In 1416 he fell again upon Kief, which he plundered, robbing
churches and monasteries. His was the first Crimean raid against Russia. Men said
that the Knights of the Cross had some share in this raid. The Order struggled twelve
years with Vitold after that terrible defeat at Tannenberg, and made peace only in
1422, at Lake Malno.
</p>
<p>About 1420 the land ruled by Vitold stretched from the Baltic to the Euxine, and from
the Western Būg to the Oká River, while his influence went far beyond those limits.
Vassili, Grand Prince of Moscow, when dying, committed his young son and heir to Vitold’s
protection, and after Vassili’s death the princes of Tver and Ryazan were at least
morally dependent on Vitold. Pskoff and Novgorod felt his hand over them, and purchased
peace with money. The Crimea Mongols, and those near the Black Sea showed fear and
respect before this strong, crafty ruler.
</p>
<p>But do what he might, he was controlled by Poland. His alliance with Yagello made
him and his cousin the first powers in Europe, but no matter what Vitold accomplished,
the whole profit of his action went surely to Poland.
</p>
<p>Yagello was not weighty as a ruler. The master mind of the Polish Commonwealth of
that day was Olesnitski, Archbishop of Cracow, and Chancellor. In 1410 this man had
been in the king’s suite at Tannenberg, and had saved the life of Yagello, whom the
Germans came very near killing. From Tannenberg began Olesnitski’s great influence.
A man of high gifts, he was unbending in all that gave profit to his religion and
his country. Vitold was baffled in everything which was not in favor of Polish interests
as Olesnitski understood them.
</p>
<p>Vitold, like his predecessors, accustomed to govern as he wished in his own state,
could not avoid looking with disquiet at the growing power of Poland in Lithuania
and Russia, and the continual decrease of the royal authority in Poland. The nobility
and clergy were absorbing all the power in the country; the king was becoming a cipher.
This was owing in part to the weakness of Yagello, who gave away the immense lands
and wealth at his disposal without <span class="pageNum" id="pb419">[<a href="#pb419">419</a>]</span>any return from them. In the union the Poles saw their one opportunity. They looked
on Russia and Lithuania as fields in which to win vast wealth and influence. At this
point Vitold strove earnestly to stop the advance of Poland, by becoming himself independent.
The best means to this end, as he thought, was to make Lithuania and Russia a kingdom.
</p>
<p>So in 1429 he arranged a meeting of sovereigns at Lutsk. King Yagello was there, with
a great suite, and numerous prelates. Vassili of Moscow, son and heir of the Grand
Prince, was present, as were the Ryazan and Tver princes. Among other rulers were
the Khan of the Crimea, the Teutonic Grand Master, the papal legate, and an ambassador
from Byzantium. The Emperor Sigismund forced the whole company to wait sixteen days
for him. Fifteen thousand people were invited; they filled Lutsk, and all places near
that city.
</p>
<p>The leading questions were opened by Sigismund, and related to Moldavia; the Hussite
wars; the union of the Eastern and Western Churches; a crusade against the Turks by
all Christians. The great question, however, was the crown of Lithuania and Russia
for Vitold. Yagello made no opposition, but would not act unless aided by the magnates
of Poland. When the question was raised for discussion, Olesnitski made a fiery speech
in opposition. The magnates were roused to the utmost, and, stopping every Polish
discussion, they left Lutsk in a body. Yagello left also, without taking leave, even
of Vitold. Sigismund followed soon after, agreeing, however, with Vitold on a new
meeting at which the crown would be given him most surely. The other guests withdrew
now, but all were invited to Vitold’s coronation in Vilna.
</p>
<p>The Lutsk meeting lasted seven weeks, and caused an immense outlay of money. Every
day one hundred barrels of mead were drunk, besides Muscat, Malvasia and wines of
various other sorts. One hundred beeves, as many sheep and wild boars, nine wild bulls,
and fourteen elks were consumed daily, besides all kinds of game known in those regions.
</p>
<p>Opposition only roused Vitold, and he determined to conquer by removing every obstacle.
He set about winning Polish partisans; but he could not influence Olesnitski, or bend
him in any way. The Pope, Martin&nbsp;V, who took the side of the Poles, would not <span class="pageNum" id="pb420">[<a href="#pb420">420</a>]</span>consent to the crowning, and advised them to abandon the project. Yagello offered
to abdicate in favor of Vitold, but the latter refused to be caught in that manner.
Olesnitski would not listen to the statement that the kingly dignity of Vitold would
not affect the desired union of the countries. Vitold’s main support was Sigismund,
who wished above all things to weaken Poland. He was supported also by the Northern
Russian nobles, who strenuously opposed union with the Poles. The existence of this
Orthodox party, schismatic, according to Catholic understanding, induced the Pope
to take the Polish side firmly.
</p>
<p>In September, 1430, the assembly met at Vilna. It was nearly the same as at Lutsk,
with about the same numbers, and of equal brilliancy. Yagello, Olesnitski, and the
Polish magnates were present. Those Poles who had been won over by Vitold did not
oppose him, but Olesnitski was as unbending as ever. Nevertheless all preparations
were made for the crowning. The assembly was only waiting for the embassy from Sigismund,
which was bringing the crown and the regalia. But the embassy came not. Sigismund
had sent a confidant with letters to Vilna and the ceremonial of the crowning. This
man was captured on the high-road to Vilna, by the Poles, who seized all his papers
and cut the crown in two. They placed armed guards at every point, and stopped Sigismund’s
embassy. Unable to advance, the embassy halted at Brandenbury, and waited for orders.
The Vilna assembly, after long waiting, dissolved by degrees, and departed.
</p>
<p>Grievous disappointment destroyed Vitold’s health; a carbuncle appeared between his
shoulders. Leaving Vilna for Troki, he grew faint on the way, and dropped to the ground
from his saddle. He died two weeks later, October 27, 1430, in his eighty-first year.
</p>
<p>After Gedimin and Olgerd, Vitold was the third and last of those princes who united
Lithuania and Western Russia. No matter how Vitold toiled to reach the goal of his
ambition, the result of his toil went to Poland. While working against union with
that country, and building a state to oppose it, he was really preparing for that
union, since the Polish kingdom was the only power served by his activity. In founding
a state east of Poland, Vitold dispossessed the Russian princes west of Moscow, and
by doing this cleared a great field for the Polish Commonwealth. He had not power
sufficient to build a new, independent, political structure. He <span class="pageNum" id="pb421">[<a href="#pb421">421</a>]</span>made agreements with Poland intending to break them, as he had broken those which
he made with the Germans. But Vitold passed away without building his kingdom, and
his agreements remained clearly written on paper. The Poles clung to those documents,
and exhibited them as title-deeds to dominion, the Magna Charta of their Commonwealth.
</p>
<p>One inheritance, however, was left to their ruin: the deposed and reduced princes
of Western Russia, and the boyars who formed somewhat later that body of magnates
which took to itself the political power of the Commonwealth, and reduced the crown
to a plaything. And since there was no central force in the Commonwealth, that Commonwealth
went to pieces. The struggle which for centuries had raged among Russian princes was
repeated in Poland on a far broader scale, and with more destructive intensity.
</p>
<p>We must now go back to events which took place in Russia during the last six years
of Vitold’s life. Though the Mongol yoke weighed yet on Russia, and liberation seemed
still at a distance, the weight of the yoke was not what it had been, even in the
reign of Dmitri. In general, people began to look on the Mongols as neighbors whom
they might, with gifts and flattery, keep in peace, and make endurable. They were
no longer masters in the old sense. Their power had reached its greatest height and
was declining. Wars and disturbances were unceasing among the various Horde fragments,
hence a Moscow prince might favor one fragment in opposition to others, and thus in
time bring it over to his side.
</p>
<p>In 1424 the Grand Prince, Vassili, fell ill, and his illness continued half a year,
till death came to him. In days preceding his illness, he had turned his main effort
to securing the inheritance to his eldest son, also Vassili by name. He took every
measure of prudence, and expressed so much confidence in Vitold, his father-in-law,
that he made him chief guardian of this young Vassili. Vitold then took an oath to
see that his grandson inherited the throne of his father. Of course the brothers of
the Grand Prince knew of this oath. But Vassili did not think that active steps would
be taken against his son by that son’s uncles. In his illness he turned to his brothers,
Andrei and Yuri, and begged them not to oppose the will by which he had made his son
Grand Prince. In commending Vassili to Vitold, one of the most powerful sovereigns
<span class="pageNum" id="pb422">[<a href="#pb422">422</a>]</span>of Europe, he must have intended to threaten his brothers. Vassili was the only son
of the Grand Prince; the other sons born to him had died earlier, so this was a favorable
condition for inheritance by the eldest from his father. But the Grand Prince himself
had brothers: Yuri, Andrei, Peter, and Constantine. The eldest would not recognize
his nephew as senior. In his will, therefore, Vassili gave the guardianship of his
heir to Vitold, and to his own brothers, Andrei, Peter and Constantine, taking no
note of Yuri.
</p>
<p>Vassili was only ten years of age when his father died. The metropolitan invited Yuri,
then in <span class="corr" id="xd32e3478" title="Source: Zvenegorod">Zvenigorod</span>, to be present in Moscow at the installation of his nephew. But Yuri hastened off
to his own land beyond the Volga to prepare for hostile action. Vassili’s mother,
his uncles, and some boyars sent the metropolitan to bring Yuri to peaceful methods.
Yuri would not listen and, angered by his refusal, the metropolitan left Galitch without
blessing that city. Straightway the plague appeared in Galitch, as the chronicler
informs us. The prince hurried after the prelate, and with difficulty brought him
back to give his blessing. Yuri now sent two envoys to Moscow with this message: “I
will not seek the principality with violence. Let the Khan say who shall have it.”
</p>
<p>But no one visited Sarai, and quiet reigned in Russia for a season. Yuri’s yielding
was caused not so much by the metropolitan, as by fear of Vitold, who had declared
that he would permit no man to offend his grandson. Meanwhile the plague spread through
Russia and brought devastation to Moscow, Tver, and Novgorod. “Suddenly and without
warning the victim would feel a sharp pain in the chest, or between the shoulders
as though struck with a dagger; blood would flow from the mouth, intense fever would
be followed by intense cold; the entrails were as though consumed by fire; tumors
appeared under the arms, on the neck or hips. Death was inevitable and swift, but
terrible.” The scourge continued for more than two years, and caused the death of
many members of the ruling house, among others four sons of Vladimir the Brave, as
well as Andrei and Peter, two uncles of Vassili.
</p>
<p>Vitold died, as we remember, in 1430, and Svidrigello, son of Olgerd, reigned in his
stead. Svidrigello was a friend of Vassili’s uncle, Yuri, and Yuri laid claim at once
to the Grand Principality. The following year, after various councils and discussions,
Vassili <span class="pageNum" id="pb423">[<a href="#pb423">423</a>]</span>set out for the Horde; then Yuri went also to get the Khan’s judgment.
</p>
<p>The rule of the Horde over Russia had weakened greatly, but it was strengthened anew
by this quarrel. Both sides had friends at Sarai. Mindulat, an official who had looked
after tribute in Moscow, was Vassili’s chief ally among the Mongols. On Yuri’s side
was the Murza Tiginya, who took Yuri to the Crimea, boasting that he would make him
Grand Prince in Russia. Among boyars attending Vassili, the first place was held by
Ivan Vsevolojski, a man who had served Vassili’s father and grandfather. This shrewd
boyar took advantage of Tiginya’s absence, and his boasting. “Tiginya says,” declared
Ivan to the Mongols, “that the Khan yields to him in all things, that every Mongol
magnate is his servant. If this be true, Yuri will succeed, for to him Tiginya has
promised the Grand Principality.” Made indignant by these biting speeches, which were
repeated to him, the Khan, Ulu Mohammed, promised to put Tiginya to death if he even
tried to help Yuri. Then he began to show favor to Vassili. Of course gifts played
a very large part in the question.
</p>
<p>When Tiginya returned in the spring of 1432, and heard of the Khan’s threats, he dared
not assist Yuri. The Khan appointed a day to decide the question. The Horde magnates
and both princes were present. Vassili rested his claim on inheritance from his father
and grandfather; Yuri on ancient custom, as proven by chronicles, and on the will
of his father Dmitri. Then Vsevolojski stepped forth and began speaking: “O free Tsar,
my sovereign,” said he, “grant a word to me, the servant of Vassili of Moscow, who
seeks the Grand Principality by thy gift and patent. Prince Yuri seeks the same through
the dead letter of ancient custom, and not, O free Sovereign, by thy document, through
which our recent sovereign gave the Grand Principality to his son now reigning in
Moscow by thy will, as thou, our lord, knowest.”
</p>
<p>This speech pleased the Khan, who, well disposed toward Vassili, adjudged him the
patent, and proposed that he mount a horse which Yuri was to lead by the bridle. But
Vassili had no wish to humiliate his uncle.
</p>
<p>As there was a war between Ulu Mohammed and Kutchuk Mohammed, the Khan, fearing the
treason of the murza Tiginya, granted at his request an enlargement of Yuri’s domain
by giving <span class="pageNum" id="pb424">[<a href="#pb424">424</a>]</span>him Dmitroff, which had belonged to Peter, his brother, but afterward Vassili took
this town.
</p>
<p>A Horde envoy, named Mansur, returned with Vassili to Moscow, and enthroned him, that
is, was present at the ceremony which took place in the Assumption Cathedral. This
is the first account of the coronation of a Grand Prince in Moscow.
</p>
<p>By confirming direct heirship from father to eldest son, the Khan aided greatly in
assuring single rule in Moscow, and prepared for the downfall of Mongol supremacy.
But a consistent policy at the Horde was at that time impossible, for each Khan had
to fight for his office. A new uprising occurred soon, and this gave Yuri, the uncle,
a chance to win the Grand Principality, without reference to the previous Khan’s decision.
</p>
<p>Yuri’s chief inciter in this struggle was that same Vsevolojski, who had previously
secured triumph to Vassili. This boyar had not toiled without reason. He had received
Vassili’s promise to marry his daughter; such a thing being usual in those days. Princes
often married daughters of boyars, and gave their own daughters in marriage to boyars.
Vsevolojski was of the Smolensk princely house, and his eldest daughter had married
a son of Vladimir the Brave. But Vassili’s mother was opposed to this marriage, and
brought about his betrothal to Maria, the granddaughter of Vladimir. Vsevolojski was
mortally offended, and passed over, or to use the phrase of the period, “went away
to take service” with Yuri, and rouse him to seek the headship of Russia.
</p>
<p>While Yuri was preparing to move on his nephew, there was a collision in Moscow, which
hastened and embittered the beginning of action. Yuri’s sons, Vassili Kosói and Dmitri
Shemyaká, were at a wedding in the palace of the Grand Prince. Vassili Kosói was wearing
a girdle of gold set with jewels. All at once an old Moscow boyar noted the girdle,
and told its whole history to Sophia, the mother of the Grand Prince. The girdle had
been received by Dmitri of the Don from the Suzdal prince as a gift with his daughter
Yevdokia, but at the time of the wedding Velyaminoff, commander of Moscow, put in
the place of this girdle another of less value, and gave this, the real one, to Nikolai,
his own son, who was married to another daughter of that same Dmitri, the Suzdal prince.
This Nikolai, who later on fell at Kulikovo, gave the girdle as a gift to his daughter
when she married <span class="pageNum" id="pb425">[<a href="#pb425">425</a>]</span>Vsevolojski, and Vsevolojski gave it with his daughter to Prince Andrei, son of Vladimir.
After Andrei’s death, his daughter was betrothed to Vassili Kosói, who received this
same precious girdle with his bride.
</p>
<p>On learning these details Sophia commanded to strip the famed girdle from Kosói. It
is difficult to credit the chronicler that she would insult a guest so rudely, remembering
the length of time since the first substitution had taken place. It is likely that
there were other reasons of enmity, and the girdle, if the story is true, was only
a pretext. In every case Kosói and his brother left the feast, burning with anger
and fully determined to make Vassili and his mother pay dearly for the insult.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince, attacked unexpectedly by Yuri, could not collect warriors in sufficient
number; he was defeated in battle, and captured. Yuri took Moscow, but in favor of
the captive now appeared Yuri’s famed boyar and counselor, Morozoff, who was either
bribed by friends of Vassili, or provoked by the triumph of Vsevolojski. He persuaded
Yuri to give Vassili the town of Kolomna, as a portion, but barely had Vassili arrived
there, when Moscow boyars and nobles rallied round him, and refused to serve Yuri.
Thus became evident the devotion of men to that mode of inheritance which secured
the possession of rights, lands and property in permanence. Princes from smaller places,
on coming to Moscow, brought with them attendants and boyars, who drove out the old
servitors. This new turn enraged Yuri’s sons greatly, so they slew Morozoff with their
own hands, and escaped from Moscow. Then Yuri, being almost abandoned, retired straightway
to Galitch, and Vassili came back to Moscow.
</p>
<p>By a new treaty between Yuri and his nephew, Yuri recognized the seniority of the
nephew. Vsevolojski, the old boyar, paid dearly for his treason. He was seized and
blinded at command of Vassili, and his lands were confiscated. As Kosói and Shemyaká
had not joined in the treaty, and had continued their warfare, Yuri himself broke
that same treaty soon after it was made. With his sons he drove out Vassili, and in
1434 took the throne a second time, but that same year he died. Kosói, his eldest
son, tried to succeed him, but Kosói’s brothers, Dmitri Shemyaká and Dmitri Krasni,
refused to accept him as Grand Prince, preferring their <span class="pageNum" id="pb426">[<a href="#pb426">426</a>]</span>cousin, Vassili. Kosói, however, did not abandon his claim, and continued the struggle.
</p>
<p>In this conflict a great part was taken by the warlike and riotous people of Vyatka,
a Novgorod colony bordering on Galitch. The princes of Galitch had completed their
regiments with the wild Vyatka warriors, and these added immensely to the fierceness
of the struggle. After ruinous attacks on northern districts Kosói met the Grand Prince
at Sokrotin, in Rostoff regions. But there he saw the superiority of his enemy and,
seeking advantage by perfidy, concluded a truce till the following morning. Vassili,
relying on this truce, sent his men for provisions. Kosói then attacked him, but Vassili
did not lose his head; he sent messengers quickly to all sides to collect his forces.
He seized a trumpet himself, and sounded it. His men rushed in, and won a complete
victory. Kosói was taken prisoner, and led to Moscow (1436). Kosói’s Vyatka warriors
committed a desperate deed: The Grand Prince’s lieutenant in Pereyaslavl, Prince Bryuhati,
was encamped near the junction of the Kotorosl and the Volga. Some tens of those Vyatka
men sailed up in the night, and at daybreak, in a fog, crept to Bryuhati’s tent, seized
him with his princess, and rushed to the boats with them. An alarm was raised quickly,
but the robbers flourished axes over the prisoners, stopped pursuit, and reached the
other bank of the river. From there they bargained, and got four hundred rubles as
ransom. Then, keeping both captives and money, they hurried off to Vyatka. For such
perfidy Kosói suffered heavily. Vassili had his eyes put out. This cruelty called
for a similar deed in retaliation, which later on was committed.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">SINGLE RULE ESTABLISHED</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Foti, the metropolitan, died in 1431. His successor was Iona, who was born at Soli-Galitch,
a place north of the Volga. The late metropolitan had favored Iona, and foretold his
elevation. On Foti’s death the Grand Prince wished to make Iona metropolitan. He was
appointed, and needed only ordination by the Patriarch, but civil war in Moscow delayed
this. In view of Moscow disorders, another metropolitan was chosen in Western Russia
and Lithuania. The Smolensk bishop Gerásim was ordained to the office in Tsargrad.
But in 1435 Gerásim met a tragic death, because of his negotiations with Sigismund
of Poland,—Vitold’s successor, Svidrigello, seized the metropolitan and burned him
at the stake. Then Vassili of Moscow, in agreement with the Lithuanian Grand Prince,
sent Iona to Tsargrad, but before he arrived there the Emperor and Patriarch had made
Isidor, a Greek, metropolitan of Russia.
</p>
<p>The Emperor Ioann was well known for his discussions with Rome touching union of the
Churches. Surrounded by the Osmanli on every side, he sought safety in church union,
trusting that the Pope would bring aid to him from all Europe. Church union had been
a question at Basle, to which council Ioann had sent three envoys, who agreed on conditions
for union. One of these three, the most zealous for union, was Isidor. Wishing to
involve Russia in the union, the Patriarch made Isidor metropolitan of Kief and all
Russia. He came to Moscow with Iona. The Grand Prince was dissatisfied; still he received
the new metropolitan, not knowing the plans of the Emperor and Patriarch. Isidor was
barely in office when he asked to make a journey to Italy to be present at the Eighth
Oecumenical Council, assembled in Ferrara at that time, 1437, to unite the two Churches.
The Grand Prince was very <span class="pageNum" id="pb428">[<a href="#pb428">428</a>]</span>unwilling to grant the metropolitan leave of absence, and demanded from him a promise
to preserve Orthodox purity in church belief.
</p>
<p>At Ferrara were the Byzantine Emperor, with his brother Dmitri and the Patriarch Iosif.
The Council was opened 1438. Pope Eugene&nbsp;IV presided. Some months later the plague
appeared at Ferrara and the Council was taken to Florence. Two parties were acting
among the Greek members; one favored union with Rome, hoping thus to get aid against
Islam, while the other would not sacrifice religion to politics for any cause. This
party refused to recognize papal supremacy, procession of the Holy Ghost from the
Son as well as the Father, and some other articles of faith. The soul of the party
was Mark, metropolitan of Ephesus. At the head of the other, and more numerous party,
stood the Emperor and the Patriarch. Its most eloquent representative was Vissarion,
metropolitan of Nicaea. Isidor, the metropolitan of Russia, was attached to this man
through long friendship; he was bound heart and soul to his project of union, and
did much for its temporary triumph.
</p>
<p>In July, 1439, in the Cathedral of Florence, was proclaimed the union of Churches.
One of the cardinals read the Latin text of the bull containing the decision of the
Council, and Vissarion read the Greek version. Among the names of the twenty metropolitans
who signed the bull is that of Isidor. The Greek minority, headed by Mark of Ephesus,
refused every signature. Eugene&nbsp;IV appointed Isidor papal legate for Livonia, and
Eastern and Western Russia; with this title he left Florence in October. In Western
Russia his first act was to publish the decision of the Council. On his return to
Moscow a Latin crucifix was borne in front of him. This confused people greatly. In
his first mass he prayed for the Pope before others, and at the end of the service
the bull was read announcing Church union. In this bull those doctrines were proclaimed
which, according to Russian ideas, form the main errors of Latinism. This reading
produced immense scandal among both the clergy and laity. The Grand Prince denounced
Isidor as a wolf, not a pastor and teacher. He commanded that he should be removed
from office at once, and conveyed to the Chudoff monastery. Then he assembled bishops
to judge the recreant.
</p>
<p>This was in 1440. Isidor did not await a decision; he fled from <span class="pageNum" id="pb429">[<a href="#pb429">429</a>]</span>the monastery, and, going through Tver and Lithuania, halted not till he reached the
Pope’s palace. The Grand Prince did not pursue him, being satisfied, it seemed, with
ending the matter in that way.
</p>
<p>In Tsargrad the union of Florence met firm resistance. The Emperor and Patriarch dared
not proclaim it in the Sophia Cathedral. The new Patriarch, Gregory Mana, a determined
advocate of the union, was forced from his office, and withdrew to Rome. Events showed
very soon that the plans made in Rome were fruitless. The Turk was not driven from
Europe. The Pope roused Yagello’s son, Vladislav, to attack the Osmanli, but Vladislav
fell in battle. In 1444 the Christian army was thoroughly defeated by Murad&nbsp;II at
Varna. The remnant of the Byzantine Empire received no aid from Western nations.
</p>
<p>Isidor was welcomed by the Pope with open arms, and made cardinal. He continued, however,
to call himself metropolitan of Russia. The next Pope, Nicholas&nbsp;V, favored Isidor
also, who was perhaps the chief agent between Rome and Byzantium. After the death
of Gregory, who had been driven from his office by adhering to the union, the Pope
appointed Isidor Patriarch. Of course the position was titular only.
</p>
<p>There was no obstacle now to the installation of Iona. The Grand Prince sent an envoy
to the Patriarch to explain Isidor’s heresy, and ask him to install a new metropolitan.
But while the envoy was on the road tidings met him from Mount Athos that the Patriarch
and Emperor had joined the church union, hence he returned to Moscow, and for eight
years there was no metropolitan in Russia.
</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1438 Ulu Mohammed (Big Mohammed) was expelled from the Horde by his
rival, Kutchuk Mohammed (Little Mohammed). Ulu Mohammed seized the town of Bailoff
on the boundary of Lithuania, and thought, as it seems, that he could win back his
throne with the aid of Vassili, to whom he had given the Grand Principality. But Vassili,
either wishing to be rid of Mongol robbery, or not desiring to quarrel with the Khan
then occupying the throne, sent against Ulu voevodas with whom Dmitri Shemyaká and
Dmitri Krasni, his two cousins, joined their forces. This army besieged the Mongols
in Bailoff. In vain did Ulu beg for peace, promising to defend Russia from other Mongols,
and never <span class="pageNum" id="pb430">[<a href="#pb430">430</a>]</span>again to ask for tribute. The Russian commanders would listen to nothing. But with
them at Bailoff was the voevoda Gregori Protasieff, sent, as it seems, by the Lithuanian
Grand Prince to help Moscow. This man betrayed his allies. He joined the Khan’s forces
and made it possible for him to inflict a defeat upon Moscow. After this victory Ulu
withdrew and halted near Nizni. At that point many Mongols came to him, and thus strengthened
he was able to make raids against Russia, and even to hold Moscow besieged for several
days in succession.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1445 the Grand Prince received news that Mongols under Mohmutek and
Yagup had been sent against Moscow. Vassili summoned a number of smaller princes and
marched out in person to drive back those forces. July 6 he halted near Suzdal, and
an encounter with the enemy took place. The Russians attacked the Mongols with vigor,
and dispersed them after a short and sharp conflict. But, while hunting the enemy,
Vassili’s men scattered, and some fell to stripping the dead. The Mongols now employed
their usual tactics. They turned suddenly and attacking on all sides, defeated the
Russians. A number of important boyars and princes were captured, among others the
Grand Prince Vassili.
</p>
<p>The Mongol commander took the cross, which Vassili wore next his body, and sent it
to Moscow to his wife and his mother, but Vassili they led away with them to Nizni.
Before going, however, they plundered many places in Vladimir and Murom.
</p>
<p>There was weeping and wailing when news came to Moscow that the Grand Prince was a
captive among Mongols; all looked for great woe, and a speedy attack on the capital.
But the Mongols did not come, and the excitement gradually died away.
</p>
<p>Vassili’s captivity was not of long duration. From Nizni, the Khan with his forces
went eastward to the edge of Moscow regions; thence he sent Baigitch, his murza, to
Dmitri Shemyaká, who heard of Vassili’s misfortune with gladness, and straightway
sent an envoy to work against liberating the prisoner. The envoy, however, was delayed
for a long time; hence the Khan thought Shemyaká an enemy, and liberated the Grand
Prince, who took an oath to give a large price for his freedom.
</p>
<p>Vassili returned to Moscow in the autumn of 1445. With him went Horde magnates, and
a crowd of attendants to receive the <span class="pageNum" id="pb431">[<a href="#pb431">431</a>]</span>promised ransom. Some of these men, pleased with Moscow, remained in Russia as subjects.
It must be noted that Vassili, in those days of Horde quarrels, had attracted princes
and murzas to his capital. He had taken these men to his service, and given land to
support them. Many Russians, not understanding his policy, were displeased to see
Mongols treated as if they were people of Moscow.
</p>
<p>Hence, when the Grand Prince had to find his large ransom, dissatisfaction rose straightway
on all sides. Shemyaká took advantage of this and brought over to his plans Vassili’s
cousin, Ivan, son of Andrei, and grandson of Vladimir the Brave. This Ivan had fought
nobly at Suzdal, where Vassili was captured. Wounded and thrown from his horse, he
had succeeded with great difficulty in mounting another, and escaping. Discontented
with a slender inheritance, as he thought it, he hoped to divide the lands of the
Grand Prince with Shemyaká, the new claimant. He and Shemyaká now arranged with the
malcontents of Moscow, and going to a place near the city, held communication daily
with those conspirators.
</p>
<p>Vassili, not knowing the plot which his enemies were weaving, went on a pilgrimage
to the Troitski monastery, with Ivan and Yuri, his two little sons. His attendants
were a few intimate boyars, and a small number of servants. Shemyaká and Ivan rushed
with all haste to Moscow and took possession of the city at night, through the help
of confederates, who opened the gates to them. The Grand Prince’s mother, Sophia,
and his wife were both captured; the treasury was pillaged; boyars faithful to Vassili
were made prisoners and their property taken; wealthy citizens were robbed without
ceremony.
</p>
<p>That same night, February 12–13, 1446, Shemyaká sent Ivan to the monastery to capture
the Grand Prince. Vassili was at mass when a man named Bunko rushed in and declared
that an enemy was approaching. Bunko had served the Grand Prince somewhat earlier,
but had left him for Shemyaká’s service. Vassili, therefore, suspected the man of
plotting, and commanded to expel him, but at the same time he sent guards out to learn
what was happening. Ivan’s men saw those guards and reported. The conspirator had
sent in a long line of sleighs, each carrying two armed men hidden under mats and
other covering. Behind each sleigh walked a <span class="pageNum" id="pb432">[<a href="#pb432">432</a>]</span>third man, who seemed to be a peasant following his load. Vassili’s guards let a number
of these sleighs pass unchallenged. All at once the line halted, and armed men sprang
out and seized the guards. As there was deep snow at each side of the road, no man
could escape to give warning to Vassili. Ivan’s men were seen only when near the monastery.
The prince rushed to the stable, but no horse was ready. The old monks were helpless;
among the younger monks some were opposed to Vassili. The prince hastened to the stone
Church of the Trinity. He entered and the sexton closed and barred the heavy door.
</p>
<p>The attackers stormed like wolves in winter; they burst into the monastery, and ran
to the Church of the Trinity. “Where is the Grand Prince?” shouted Ivan. Hearing Ivan’s
voice, Vassili opened the door, and implored for his eyesight. Ivan commanded to seize
him. Nikita, a boyar, obeyed his command. “Thou art taken,” said he, “by Dmitri, son
of Yuri, Grand Prince of Moscow.” “God’s will be done,” replied Vassili.
</p>
<p>They placed him in a rough country sleigh and conducted him to Moscow. His attendant
boyars were seized also, but in their haste the attackers forgot the two young princes,
Ivan and Yuri, who had hidden, and when Ivan and his men had left the monastery the
boys and those who were with them found refuge with Prince Ryapolovski in his village,
Boyar Kovo. Later Ryapolovski and his brothers took the princes to Murom, and shut
themselves up in the city, where a large force of warriors soon assembled.
</p>
<p>February 14, Prince Ivan reached Moscow and lodged Vassili at Shemyaká’s court, where
three days later his enemies blinded him, accusing him thuswise: “Thou didst bring
Mongols to Russia, and give them land. Thy love for those enemies and their speech
is beyond measure; thou givest gold, lands, and silver to them; thy oppression of
churches is unsparing. Also thou didst blind Prince Vassili, son of Yuri.” Then they
sent him, with his princess, to Uglitch. Sophia, his mother, they sent to Chuhloma.
</p>
<p>Shemyaká began then to reign as Grand Prince in Moscow; his success was short-lived,
however. Many princes would not recognize this new man. In Moscow not all the boyars
took the oath, and soon complaints and indignation rose mightily against <span class="pageNum" id="pb433">[<a href="#pb433">433</a>]</span>him. His Galitch boyars and attendants seized the best places. People were not gratified
when they saw that he was beginning to divide Moscow lands, consolidated with so much
toil by preceding princes. Shemyaká soon felt his weakness, and determined to get
Vassili’s sons into his power. At his request the nominated metropolitan, Iona, went
to Murom and, by promising that Vassili should be liberated, persuaded the Ryapolovskis
to surrender the little princes.
</p>
<p>Not merely was Vassili not liberated, but his sons were imprisoned with him in Uglitch.
A great movement began then throughout Moscow regions in favor of the imprisoned and
blinded prince. It was agreed by the Ryapolovskis, by Obolenski, and others to meet
at Uglitch, storm the town, and free Vassili. Some reached the place, but others were
waylaid by Shemyaká’s warriors. Thereupon they attacked and defeated those warriors,
and brought in fresh assistants. Seeing that more and more men were leaving him, Shemyaká
listened at last to Iona, who ceased not to complain that he had been used as a tool
in taking the sons of Vassili from Murom. “What can a man without eyesight do?” asked
Iona. “Besides, his sons are little children. Bind him to peace by an oath, and the
bishops.”
</p>
<p>Shemyaká went to Uglitch with abbots, boyars, and bishops, freed Vassili from prison,
and begged forgiveness. The blind man said that he had suffered for his sins; he showed
great mildness, blaming only himself. Shemyaká, after taking an oath from Vassili
that he would not seek power for himself or for his children, gave a great feast as
evidence that they were reconciled. Vassili promised that he and his sons would live
in distant Vologda. But barely was he free when the new oath was ignored, and the
rôle changed completely. From Vologda Vassili went, as it were, on a pilgrimage to
the Cyril Bailozero monastery. There many boyars and other men came to him, deserting
his opponent. Trifon, the abbot of Bailozero, freed Vassili from the oath given his
enemy, taking on himself the sin of breaking it. Then Vassili set out for Tver to
obtain the co-operation of Prince Boris and make a league with him against Shemyaká.
The alliance was made, and Boris betrothed his daughter to Ivan, Vassili’s eldest
son.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile those attendants of Vassili who had fled to Lithuania gathered their warriors
and marched to free the Grand Prince, <span class="pageNum" id="pb434">[<a href="#pb434">434</a>]</span>but on the way they learned that he was already free. They met Mongol troops and fell
to fighting. “Who are ye?” inquired the Mongols. “We are men of Moscow hastening to
free Prince Vassili, our sovereign.” “We too,” replied the Mongols, “are going with
our two princes, Kasin and Yagup, to rescue Prince Vassili in return for kindness.”
Both parties now advanced to aid Vassili.
</p>
<p>Shemyaká and Prince Ivan had despatched troops to block the Moscow road before the
boyar Pleschyeff, sent by Vassili to Moscow. But Pleschyeff marched around Shemyaká’s
troops very cleverly, and reached Moscow Christmas morning. The gates had just been
thrown open for the Princess Julianna, a daughter-in-law of Vladimir the Brave. Vassili’s
uncle, Pleschyeff, and his men rushed in behind her suite, and seized the Kremlin
immediately. Learning that warriors were marching from Tver with Vassili, that other
forces were hurrying from the west, and that the Kremlin was taken, Shemyaká and Ivan
fled to Kargopol. At Vassili’s demand they now freed his mother, Sophia. They then
begged for peace, and it was granted, but Shemyaká did not keep the conditions which
he himself had put forward. He began at once to work against Vassili, who, when he
had received undoubted proof of the perfidy, placed the question before the clergy.
</p>
<p>Then in the name of all spiritual persons a letter was written to Shemyaká. It began
by reminding him of the offenses of Yuri, his father; it recounted his own crimes,
comparing him to Cain, the first murderer, and to Sviatopolk the Accursed. It reproached
him with treason, with robber attacks on the Grand Prince; with the blinding of Vassili,
and other offenses. In conclusion, it asked him to observe his own treaty, otherwise
he would be cursed and deprived of communion.
</p>
<p>Threatened not only with a curse, but with warriors of the Grand Prince, Shemyaká
strengthened the treaty with a new oath. But soon he was false to this oath also,
and renewed the civil war, which continued a number of years. At last Vassili’s troops,
led by Obolenski, reached Galitch, now fortified strongly, and armed well with cannon.
After a stubborn engagement Shemyaká was defeated and fled to Novgorod. Galitch yielded
to Vassili, and in 1450 its citizens took the oath to him.
</p>
<p>The battle of Galitch was the last struggle of note between <span class="pageNum" id="pb435">[<a href="#pb435">435</a>]</span>Russian princes. After that Shemyaká made a number of efforts. He marched against
Ustyug and Vologda, but his acts were mere senseless destruction of property. At last,
in Moscow, it was thought best to bring his intimates, by rewards, to abandon him.
It is stated that he died in Novgorod in 1453, after eating a chicken which his own
cook had poisoned. Vassili Baida came galloping to Moscow with news of his death.
For this news he received a good office.
</p>
<p>Thus ended a strife which had lasted two decades. It cost Moscow dearly, and delayed
for a time the final ending of subjection to Mongols. But it had its own value also
in developing single rule strongly in Russia. This struggle showed how firmly the
new order was established. All classes stood on its side now, and favored its triumph.
During Shemyaká’s warfare, Vassili the Dark (that is, blind), as men called him, spared
all the other small princes lest they might join his rival, but when Shemyaká, that
last champion of the old order of things, had vanished, Vassili was unsparingly stern
to opposition, and seized the land of all warring princes.
</p>
<p>His cousin Ivan, grandson of Vladimir the Brave, who had aided Shemyaká, and betrayed
the Grand Prince very often, even trying to bring the Polish king, Kazimir, to Moscow,
was expelled from Mojaisk forever. He fled to Lithuania, and his portion was added
to Moscow. Vassili of Serpukoff, who had formed a conspiracy against the Grand Prince,
was seized and died later in prison. His son, Ivan, went to Lithuania, as did Shemyaká’s
son, and Ivan of Majaisk; there the exiles spent their time in framing fruitless plots
against Moscow. Toward the end of Vassili’s reign all minor places had been incorporated,
save only Vereisk. The prince of that place had always been faithful, and Vassili
did not disturb him.
</p>
<p>While assimilating the land of small princes, Vassili extended his influence over
the Tver and Ryazan principalities. He undertook a campaign against Novgorod which
ended in establishing Novgorod’s dependence on Moscow; he also subjected Vyatka, that
disorderly nest of freebooters.
</p>
<p>Iona had aided Vassili more than many, and Vassili determined to make him metropolitan.
He could not turn then to Tsargrad, for Isidor, who had fled from Moscow, not only
continued to call <span class="pageNum" id="pb436">[<a href="#pb436">436</a>]</span>himself metropolitan of Russia, but was recognized as such by the Patriarch and Emperor.
At the call of the Grand Prince, the bishops of Russia held a council in the Archangel
Cathedral. Referring for authority to the rules of the Apostles and early churches,
they ordained Iona December 5, 1448. Thus was created the first Russian metropolitan
entirely independent of Tsargrad.
</p>
<p>The importance of this step was well understood in Russia. Its legality was proven.
Iona wrote an epistle to his flock, a special one to Kief, and several to Western
Russia. In those epistles he justified his installation, a work not superfluous in
that time, for even in Moscow there were men who considered his elevation as contrary
to Orthodox usage.
</p>
<p>When news came that the throne in Tsargrad was occupied by Constantine, instead of
Ioann, the defender of the Florentine union, the Grand Prince sent a letter, in which
he explained his whole course with Iona and Isidor, and asked final blessing from
the Patriarch on the former. But communication with Tsargrad in those days had grown
uncertain, through robber bands on the road, and disorders in the Empire itself.
</p>
<p>Then came the tidings that Tsargrad had fallen, and that Constantine had died while
defending the city, May 29, 1453. This sad event in the Orthodox East aided the complete
liberation of Russia from Tsargrad.
</p>
<p>The close connection between each metropolitan and Grand Prince, and the tendencies
of Moscow to consolidate brought disagreement between the Moscow metropolitan and
the Grand Princes of Lithuania, since the latter were rivals of the Moscow Grand Prince,
especially after the Latinizing of Lithuania; hence the attempts to get a separate
metropolitan for Western Russia. Finally, in Iona’s day, despite all his efforts,
the separation of the Russian Church into two parts was effected. This was grievous
to Iona. He wrote in vain to the Western Russian bishops, princes and boyars, to all
the Western Russian people, advising them to stand firmly for the Orthodox religion.
</p>
<p>Three years later Iona died. His successor, Thedosi, Archbishop of Rostoff, was ordained
by Russian bishops; thus this system was confirmed finally in Russia.
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince Vassili died in 1462, before he had reached his fiftieth year. In
the second half of his reign, Vassili the Blind <span class="pageNum" id="pb437">[<a href="#pb437">437</a>]</span>was no longer the active, rather simple, and somewhat light-minded person that he
had been in his youth. Not so much years as bitter suffering and experience, and especially
the loss of his eyesight, developed adroitness and stern resolution. He brought into
his own hands almost all the principalities near Moscow, and advanced very greatly
the union effected by his immediate successor. At his death Russia included, besides
the enlarged principality of Moscow, four independent lands, that is, Pskoff and Novgorod,
with the Tver and Ryazan principalities.
</p>
<p>To give a brief picture of affairs in Lithuania and Russia is now indispensable for
an understanding of Moscow. We must return to the beginning of Vassili’s reign.
</p>
<p>The death of Vitold of Lithuania, in 1430, without heirs raised the great question:
Who shall succeed? The former Russo-Lithuanian Grand Prince, Yagello, at that time
King of Poland, hesitated to put the two crowns on his own head, fearing opposition
from the Russo-Lithuanian boyars, who struggled against merging their own state in
Poland. Besides Yagello, there were two grandsons of Gedimin, Svidrigello, Yagello’s
younger brother, and Sigismund, the youngest brother of Vitold. There were also grandsons
of Olgerd, but being of the Orthodox faith they were unacceptable to the Poles, and
to Catholics. <span class="corr" id="xd32e3588" title="Source: Yaegllo">Yagello</span> gave the preference to his brother, who succeeded Vitold, and was crowned in the
Vilna Cathedral. But Yagello was mistaken in thinking that he had found an obedient
assistant. Though Svidrigello had gone over to the Latins through the influence of
his brother, he was not a zealot, and was well inclined toward his former co-religionists.
Having ruled in Russian principalities, he was Russian in language and sympathies;
hence the Russians greeted his elevation, and expected aid from him against Latinism
and absorption.
</p>
<p>Svidrigello had no wish to be a servant. He looked on the Grand Principality as his
by right, and wished to preserve the integrity of his inheritance. In one word, his
wish was to follow the policy of Vitold. Polish magnates were greatly displeased that
the king had permitted this brother to be crowned without pledges, and had yielded
Podolia and Volynia, which they claimed for themselves, and which, as they said, they
had fought for.
</p>
<p>The taking of Galitch by Kazimir the Great was the first exploit <span class="pageNum" id="pb438">[<a href="#pb438">438</a>]</span>in distributing the lands of Russia among Polish nobles and the clergy, and also of
taking lands from Russian owners, and giving them to Poles. This system had extended
to Podolia from Galitch, a part of which had been joined to Poland. But in Vitold’s
day Podolia had been given back to Russia almost entirely. In cities and castles were
representatives of the Grand Prince supported by Russo-Lithuanian garrisons.
</p>
<p>No one supposed that Svidrigello would surrender Podolia and Volynia to Yagello, hence
the Poles planned to capture them by stratagem. Kamenyets, the chief Podolian city,
was commanded by Dovgerd, a noted Lithuanian. The local Polish nobles appeared at
the castle of Kamenyets before the news of Vitold’s death had reached it. They came
under protext of friendly consultation, and invited Dovgerd to meet them with his
attendants. He did so. The Poles threw off the mask then, seized him with his attendants,
and took possession of the castle. At the same time they surprised Smotritch, with
a few other places, and thus won a part of Podolia. The voevodas of Volynia had heard
of Vitold’s death and were prepared. There the Poles could obtain nothing.
</p>
<p>Svidrigello was indignant when he heard of what had happened at Kamenyets. Yagello
was still in Lithuania, hunting; he had not returned since the funeral of Vitold.
Svidrigello reproached the king bitterly, and declared that he would hold him a captive
till Podolia was returned to its Grand Prince. Yagello met his brother’s outburst
of anger and accusation with mild and insinuating speeches. But Svidrigello was unyielding.
The king’s Polish suite proposed then a desperate measure: to kill Svidrigello, capture
the Vilna castle, and defend themselves till aid came. The king would not consent
to this murder, but to effect his escape he made an agreement by which he returned
the castles in Podolia to his brother, and commanded Butchatski to yield Kamenyets
to Prince Michael Baba, Svidrigello’s commander. Svidrigello was delighted. He rewarded
Yagello’s messenger well, then he made rich presents to Yagello and his suite, and
they departed for Poland. Despite his sixty years, Svidrigello had let himself be
badly deceived.
</p>
<p>Polish magnates near the king, perhaps with his connivance, thought out a stratagem.
They sent a private letter to Butchatski, forbidding him to obey Yagello’s order to
yield Kamenyets, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb439">[<a href="#pb439">439</a>]</span>commanding him to arrest Prince Baba and the messenger. The letter was placed in a
tube which was covered with wax and made to look like a candle. This counterfeit candle
was taken to Butchatski by an attendant of the king’s messenger, who said, as he delivered
it: “You will find in this candle all the light needed.” Real candles were burned
before images, and were sent to chapels and churches, therefore this candle roused
no suspicion. Butchatski cut the candle, found the letter, and followed its instructions.
</p>
<p>When he heard of the trick Svidrigello was enraged. He tried to recover the castles,
but took only a few of them; Smotritch and Kamenyets remained with his opponents.
The Poles now declared that Svidrigello must surrender not only Podolia, but Lutsk,
and the south of Volynia. They demanded too that he should go to Poland and take an
oath of obedience to Yagello. Svidrigello refused to do this. He made a treaty with
the Germans, and with the Emperor. Sigismund opposed the growth of Poland, and desired
the Order to assist Svidrigello, to whom he promised the same kind of crown that he
had sent to Vitold.
</p>
<p>From the Polish king now came an envoy with reproaches. He condemned Svidrigello savagely
for his alliance with the enemies of Poland. The envoy added also that Svidrigello
was not a Grand Prince till so acknowledged by a Polish Diet. Svidrigello, borne away
by furious anger, detained the Polish envoy, and had him imprisoned. After this insult
there was no way to decide the dispute except by armed action.
</p>
<p>In 1431 the king led a large army into Volynia. The Poles were distinguished for their
fury in that war; so irrepressible was it that the people were forced to hide in forests
and swamps, and in inaccessible places. The king, to spare native regions, tried to
curb the troops under him; he even warned people of his coming, and thus incurred
the taunt that he was sparing his rebel brother. The Poles sacked Vladimir; Volynia
was burned. Svidrigello, with Wallachians and Mongols, was preparing to meet the invasion,
but discovering the great strength of the king’s forces, he withdrew and burned Lutsk
to save it from the enemy. In the Lutsk castle he put Yursha, a Russian, who defended
that stronghold so stubbornly that the Poles could not take it. Angered by this defeat,
they accused the king of malevolent slackness, and of intentional blunders.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb440">[<a href="#pb440">440</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Polish camp disease attacked the men, and a distemper broke out among the horses.
Food failed. German knights declared war, and invaded northern provinces. These calamities
caused the king to offer peace. The Grand Prince accepted, and concluded a truce without
consulting the Germans. Svidrigello retained what he had when the war broke out, that
is Eastern Podolia, and Volynia entire. He had vindicated independence for the lands
under him, but beyond that the result of the war was merely plunder and bloodshed.
</p>
<p>At the head of Polish affairs was Olesnitski, the chancellor, at that time cardinal.
On meeting failure in the field he sought other means to subject Svidrigello. A rival
was selected, Sigismund, Vitold’s youngest brother. Sigismund was to claim the Grand
Principality; and in various ways a party was created to support him. A revolt was
brought about and Svidrigello, being careless and improvident, was surprised and very
nearly captured by his rival. He escaped by desperate speed, but his wife was seized.
Vilna and Troki surrendered. Soon Lithuania acknowledged Sigismund, while Russia adhered
to Svidrigello.
</p>
<p>Sigismund was crowned in Vilna, where a papal bull was read freeing Lithuania from
its oath to Svidrigello. In Grodno, somewhat earlier, before senators and Olesnitski,
Sigismund had surrendered the regions of Lutsk, and its lands, as well as Podolia
and Goróden.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Svidrigello had no intention of yielding to Sigismund broad regions which
were still in his possession. Help was coming to him from the Tver prince. His Russian
voevodas were successful. Alexander Nos defended Kief lands, and Prince Ostrogski,
Volynia. Especially distinguished was Fedko, who, with help of Wallachians and Mongols,
not only repulsed the Poles in Podolia, but seized Kamenyets, luring Butchatski from
the fortress, and taking him captive.
</p>
<p>During this war Yagello died at the age of eighty-six. Thus ended a reign of fifty
years, a reign memorable in Eastern Europe. The two great results of his life were
the union of Lithuania and Poland, and the reduction of the royal power till it was
a mere shadow. Now the nobles, with Olesnitski at the head of them, became <span class="corr" id="xd32e3614" title="Source: allpowerful">all-powerful</span>. Instead of combining his provinces, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb441">[<a href="#pb441">441</a>]</span>organizing an army, Svidrigello sought alliances, treated with Sigismund, with the
Germans, with the Khan, and with the Pope. All this proved his unfitness, and weakened
the attachment of the Orthodox party. Besides he was passionate, given to anger, and
cruel. He sometimes punished with death those adherents of Sigismund whom he captured.
For example, he had one of the princes, Olshanski, sewn up in a bag and drowned in
the Dvina. Worse than all of his evil deeds, he burned at the stake the metropolitan
Gerásim, for an unknown reason, but presumably for communicating with Sigismund.
</p>
<p>A decisive battle was fought near Vilkomir, in which Sigismund was victor. Svidrigello
fled to Kief, and found refuge there, while Smolensk, Polotsk and <span class="corr" id="xd32e3622" title="Source: Vitbsk">Vitebsk</span> received lieutenants from Sigismund. Svidrigello had still a part of Podolia, much
of Volynia and the whole of the Kief principality, in which Yursha, his brave voevoda,
was commanding, but feeling that he had not sufficient power to continue the struggle,
he went to Cracow and offered to become a feudatory of Poland.
</p>
<p>Sigismund was active against him, and spared nothing in bribery. He demanded for himself
all that Svidrigello had held, and his side succeeded. Svidrigello, fearing to fall
into Sigismund’s clutches, withdrew to Wallachia, and Kief and Volynia were given
to Sigismund, on condition that after he died Lithuania and Russia should be given
to Poland.
</p>
<p>So the war ended with victory for Sigismund, but he had little profit from his triumph.
The humiliating position in which the new prince had put his own office roused opposition
among Lithuanians and Russians. Especially active were Olgerd’s descendants in fighting
against this son of Keistut, who had seized power unjustly, as it seemed to them.
Their indignation was increased by the cruelty with which Sigismund hunted down every
opponent. Men of the highest distinction were imprisoned and deprived of their property,
while others were put to death without cause.
</p>
<p>When Sigismund summoned a Diet, the report went out quickly that that was only a trap
to ruin princes and boyars. Unable to cast down the tyrant, for he was surrounded
by Polish defenders, they formed a conspiracy, at the head of which stood a Russian,
Prince Chartoriski, Dovgerd, voevoda of Vilna, and Lelyush, <span class="pageNum" id="pb442">[<a href="#pb442">442</a>]</span>who commanded in Troki. The conspirators used the hay tribute to carry out their stratagem.
</p>
<p>In the night before Palm Sunday, March, 1440, three hundred sleighs bringing hay were
drawn into Troki. In each sleigh two or three armed men were secreted, and with each
went a driver,—in all a thousand men or more. The following morning Sigismund’s son,
Michael, went, accompanied by his father’s attendants, to early mass in the cathedral.
During mass the men hidden in the hay came out, shut the gates of the fortress, and
were led into the castle by Chartoriski. Sigismund, without leaving his bed, was hearing
mass offered up by a priest in a chapel adjoining his chamber. He had a tame bear
which served as a guard near his person; when the beast wished to enter he scratched
at the door for admission. Chartoriski, seeing the bear in the courtyard, and knowing
its habit, scratched on the door in imitation. The door was opened, and the conspirators
entered. Skobeiko, equerry to Sigismund, but now false to him, seized an iron poker
from the fireplace, and struck the prince on the head with such violence that his
blood and brains stained the walls of the chamber. Slavko, a favorite and intimate
of the Grand Prince, tried to shield his master; but he was hurled through the window
and instantly killed. The body of the dead prince was conveyed in a sleigh to the
lake, and left on the ice there; later it was buried, near Vitold’s grave, in the
Cathedral of Vilna.
</p>
<p>When news of this terrible crime spread through Troki, there was a great outbreak.
Michael and his attendants took refuge in a small castle on an island of the lake
near Troki. Lelyush seized the main castle in the name of Svidrigello, and hung out
his white banner above it. Dovgerd did the same in Vilna, but in Vilna the upper castle
was taken by adherents of Michael. Meanwhile couriers raced off for Svidrigello. He
hurried back from Moldavia, and appearing at Lutsk, was received with gladness by
the people. Men imprisoned in strongholds of Lithuania and Russia were freed, but
Svidrigello, instead of hastening to Vilna and Troki and securing the throne, which
had come to him a second time, loitered in Lutsk till affairs changed again, and not
to his profit.
</p>
<p>In Olshani a number of noted Lithuanians met and resolved to depose both Svidrigello
and Michael, and make Yagello’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb443">[<a href="#pb443">443</a>]</span>youngest son, Kazimir, Grand Prince. It seemed to these magnates that they might rear
this young boy in the ways of the country and manage it themselves during his minority.
The Polish magnates insisted that the Lithuanian throne belonged to their actual king,
Vladislav, who at ten years of age had been named as Yagello’s successor, but Vladislav,
having been made king in Hungary, and being attracted by the war just beginning with
Turkey, was willing to yield Lithuania to his brother. Still the Poles insisted that
Kazimir, not being a sovereign, but only a viceroy, should be called prince, and not
Grand Prince. This angered Lithuanians, who considered him sovereign, and they acted
as follows:
</p>
<p>Young Kazimir came to Vilna with a large, brilliant suite, and attended by senators
from Poland. The Lithuanian magnates prepared a great banquet to show him honor, and
plied Polish senators with wine so generously that they were all fast asleep on the
following morning. Very early in the day of July 3, 1440, the Lithuanians crowned
Kazimir in the Vilna Cathedral, putting on his head the Grand Prince’s cap worn by
Gedimin. They then gave him the sword, and placed on his shoulders the Grand Prince’s
mantle. The Poles were roused from their slumbers by the thundering shouts of the
people, who were greeting their new sovereign. Rich gifts were given to the senators,
and they could do nothing but hide their mortification and displeasure, and reply
with good wishes.
</p>
<p>Not slight was the task which confronted young Kazimir. The preceding wars with their
manifold miseries, the frosts, untimely and terrible, the failure of harvests, famine,
the pestilence, and other visitations are mentioned continually in the chronicle.
Besides, many regions refused to accept him as Grand Prince. The king would not acknowledge
him, and the Poles were ever ready to uphold his opponents, so as to break up the
Grand Principality, and take in its fragments one after another more easily. Hence
Svidrigello received Volynia and part of Podolia from the Polish king. Michael, son
of that Sigismund murdered at Troki, joined with Mazovian princes, and gave them Berestei.
Jmud, which rose against Kazimir, sided with Michael. Smolensk was rebellious in like
manner, but Ivan Gashtold, the Grand Prince’s guardian and chief of his council of
magnates, pacified all. Even <span class="pageNum" id="pb444">[<a href="#pb444">444</a>]</span>Michael came finally to Vilna, and made peace with Kazimir, receiving from him those
same places which Sigismund, his father, had held till he was murdered.
</p>
<p>This peace, however, proved hollow, for Michael was raging against Kazimir in secret,
and plotting to take the throne from him at any cost.
</p>
<p>Once, when the Grand Prince was learning to hunt, some hundreds of men well armed
and mounted appeared in the forest. The moment notice was given of their coming, Andrei
Gashtold, the son of Ivan, seized young Kazimir and galloped away with him to Troki.
Gashtold, the father, sent warriors to hunt down the horsemen. Some were killed, others
made captive; among the latter were five Russian princes, the brothers Volojinski,
who were put to death straightway in Troki. Gasthold then hurried off toward Bryansk
to meet Michael. But Michael had fled to Moscow, and his lands were confiscated straightway.
</p>
<p>With Svidrigello the action was simpler. He abandoned the king, and gave oath to Kazimir,
who was his nephew. Kazimir left Svidrigello, his old, childless uncle, in Volynia,
giving Kief with all its connections to Alexander, his cousin, a grandson of Olgerd
and son of Vladimir. Smolensk was not managed so easily, but still it was managed,
and kept for the Grand Principality.
</p>
<p>Barely had Kazimir, acting through Gashtold, brought peace to the princedom and saved
its integrity, when new troubles and new dangers came from Poland. The Polish-Hungarian
king, Vladislav, brother of Kazimir, attracted by his kingdom of Hungary and his struggle
with Turkey, left Lithuania and Russia unmolested; but in 1444 that young king fell
at Varna, and his death destroyed the new union between Hungary and Poland. The Poles
had their election in 1445, and chose Kazimir. The union with Hungary being lost,
they were all the more eager for the Russo-Lithuanian connection. If a king, not descended
from Yagello, took the throne, every bond between Poland and the Grand Principality
would be severed, but as the election of Kazimir gave the chance not only of preserving
this bond, but of merging the Grand Principality in Poland, his election was favored
by Poles without exception. This desire of the Poles to subject the principality and
find in it lands, wealth and offices was irrepressible, and roused great indignation
in Russia, for the nobles valued their <span class="pageNum" id="pb445">[<a href="#pb445">445</a>]</span>independence, and the Orthodox clergy feared Latin encroachment.
</p>
<p>Young Kazimir, grown accustomed to Russia, liked its ways and its language. Besides,
the sovereign had power in Russia, while in Poland he had none. So when first his
election was suggested, he answered evasively, saying that his brother’s death was
still doubtful. At last the Poles used diplomacy to force him. They feigned to elect
a Mazovian, Prince Boleslav, and to prepare for the coronation. This election meant
war for the land claimed by Boleslav, and also a new war with Michael by Boleslav
himself. The prospect of two wars, and the words of his mother brought conviction
to Kazimir. In June, 1447, he was crowned with solemnity in Cracow.
</p>
<p>The time following Kazimir’s election was remarkable for boisterous Diets. The Poles
sought to turn Lithuania and Russia into provinces of their kingdom. They claimed
all Podolia and Volynia, with the Upper Bug region. Feodor Butchatski succeeded in
seizing some castles, and placing Polish troops in them. The Russo-Lithuanian magnates
were indignant. With burning words they defended the integrity of their country at
the Diets, and demanded the return of Volynia and Podolia to their proper connection.
They showed that historically those regions were theirs beyond question. The Poles
referred to their own former conquests, as they called them. They referred to the
Horodlo union, and treaties with various Lithuanian princes. The Lithuanians rejected
those statements, and declared that from the Horodlo pact should be excluded certain
words touching the union of Lithuania and Poland, words inserted without their knowledge,
and in secret.
</p>
<p>The position of the king was unenviable. At first he was under the influence of Gashtold
and others, and also of his own feelings, but as king he was powerless to counteract
the demands of Polish nobles, who, besides the union of Russo-Lithuanian provinces,
asked for confirmation of certain rights granted by Yagello, and demanded still others
restricting royal action. There were two Polish parties at this time, those of Great
and Little Poland. Great Poland formed what is now Poznan, Little Poland that part
of the present Austrian Poland which has its center at Cracow. The men of Great Poland
were mainly indifferent to questions <span class="pageNum" id="pb446">[<a href="#pb446">446</a>]</span>in the Grand Principality, because they were distant. Little Poland, on the contrary,
turned every effort toward those questions. Immense lands, great careers, and much
power were to be won through getting Lithuania and Russia. The head of the Little
Poland party was Olesnitski, the chancellor. He held the first place in all councils;
behind him stood the party in Cracow. The queen mother supported the chancellor. The
young king yielded much to Olesnitski, who had made Sigismund Grand Prince, and was
now working ardently for Michael, and urging the king to give him lands in Lithuania
and be reconciled. The king would not listen to this; he did not forget that this
same Michael had striven to kill him.
</p>
<p>Michael, after fleeing from Gashtold, had tarried in Moscow for some time, and, with
help of the Mongols, had endeavored to seize lands from Lithuania. Vassili the Blind
had supported him, while Kazimir had upheld the opponents of Vassili. Failing at last,
Michael went to Moldavia, then to Silesia, and afterward back to Moscow. But by this
time Vassili of Moscow had agreed with Lithuania, consequently he refused to help
Michael further. At last Michael died, it is stated through poison given by some abbot,—poison
of such power that the prince died immediately. Then the abbot, terrified by the thought
of vengeance from Michael’s cousin, Sophia, the daughter of Vitold, also drank of
the poison and died.
</p>
<p>That same year, 1450, died Svidrigello at Lutsk. Persecuted by the Poles all his life,
he had hated them thoroughly, and had taken from his boyars an oath to give the land
only to agents of the Grand Prince of Moscow. After his death all places were occupied
by Russo-Lithuanian garrisons in the name of the Grand Prince. The Poles were incensed,
and announced a campaign to recover those places. But the opposition of the king,
and the unwillingness of Great Poland to take part in a struggle, cooled Cracow statesmen,
who were forced to be satisfied for the moment with verbal attacks on the king, and
hot quarrels with the Russo-Lithuanian contingent of the Commonwealth. The quarrels
at last became so savage that all save Poles left the Diet, and went from the place
secretly in the night-time.
</p>
<p>After that the king had great trouble in allaying the bitter hatred and rancor of
parties, and in the next Diet, formed of Poles only, he yielded, confirming all the
rights demanded, and taking an <span class="pageNum" id="pb447">[<a href="#pb447">447</a>]</span>oath never to alienate from Poland any lands which had ever belonged to it, among
others the lands of Lithuania, Moldavia, and Russia. More important still, the king
bound himself to keep near his person at all times a council made up of four Poles,
and to remove the Lithuanians who were hostile to Poland.
</p>
<p>In 1455 Olesnitski, the cardinal, died, at a time when the Poles were beginning a
war which proved most serious.
</p>
<p>In Prussia there had long been a dull and stubborn conflict between towns and lay
landholders on one side, and the Order, composed of Knights of the Cross, on the other.
The Order, retaining all authority, burdened the people with great dues and taxes,
and hampered the Hanse towns in their traffic. Certain landholders had formed against
the Order a league called the Brotherhood. To this Brotherhood almost all the large
trading towns joined themselves. In the struggle which followed, the Pope and the
Emperor inclined toward the Order. The league turned to Kazimir, and signed a pact
making the Prussian lands subject to Poland, reserving for itself various privileges
as to trade, taxes, and government.
</p>
<p>But now the need came to defend this position. The German Order, notwithstanding its
fall, had much force still left, as well as the energy to resist for a long time,
and even in 1454 it inflicted on Kazimir a notable defeat on the field of Choinitsi.
After that the war lasted with changing results for twelve years. Then the Order,
having exhausted its forces, sued for peace, and in 1466 received it at Thorn through
the aid of the papal legate.
</p>
<p>By this peace the lands of Culm and Pomerania, with the cities Marienburg, Dantzig
and Elbing, went to Poland, but Eastern Prussia, with Königsberg, its capital, remained
with the Order, which assumed certain feudal relations to Poland. The main reason
why the war was so long and ended without conquering the Order completely, is found
in the quarrels and struggles between the Poles and the Russo-Lithuanians. The latter
refrained almost entirely from taking part in the conflict, and the whole weight of
it fell upon Poland. Though the same sovereign was both king and Grand Prince, he
had so little authority in Poland, and was so hampered by parties that he had no power
to make the three countries act as one body. Dlugosh, the Polish historian, declares
that in the Grand Principality Russians and Lithuanians <span class="pageNum" id="pb448">[<a href="#pb448">448</a>]</span>opposed to the Poles had secret relations with the Order, against which the Poles
were then warring.
</p>
<p>The first prince in Kief descended from Gedimin, and under a Grand Prince of that
descent also, was Gedimin’s grandson, Vladimir, son of Olgerd. In his long rule of
thirty years, from 1362 to 1392, the old city rested to a certain extent, and recovered
considerably from the terrible destruction wrought by Batu and other Mongol khans.
</p>
<p>Orthodox in religion, and Russian externally, Vladimir cared for the Orthodox Church
of Kief regions, and wished the metropolitan to reside in that ancient city; hence
he supported Cyprian when Dmitri would not admit him to Moscow. When Vitold became
Grand Prince of Lithuania, he drove out Vladimir, and put him in Kopyl, a small district.
Kief he gave to Vladimir’s brother, Skirgello, in 1392. Vladimir tried hard to get
the aid of Vassili of Moscow, but he met with no success, and spent the last years
of his life in Kopyl. Skirgello, who in action was much like his brother, lived only
four years. After his death Vitold, who wished to break up the old system, put no
prince in Kief; he governed the city through agents, the first of whom was his confidant,
Prince Olshanski.
</p>
<p>Svidrigello, at the beginning of his rule as Grand Prince, placed Yursha, his valiant
assistant, in Kief. When expelled from northwestern regions by Sigismund, Svidrigello
found refuge in Kief, and that city became the center of a large political division.
Svidrigello, notwithstanding his official change from Orthodox faith to Latinity,
was attached to his old Church. When the dignity of Grand Prince went to Yagello’s
son, Kazimir, Svidrigello got Lutsk, and Ivan Gashtold, the guardian of Kazimir, thought
it needful to yield to the boyars and the Russian party; hence he gave the Kief region
to the son of Vladimir of Kopyl, that is, to Prince Alexander, whose surname was Olelko.
Alexander, being a grandson of Olgerd, and married to the daughter of Vassili, the
Grand Prince of Moscow, was a man of distinction, therefore Sigismund, the son of
Keistut, thought him dangerous, and imprisoned him with his wife and two sons. He
remained in prison till death removed Sigismund.
</p>
<p>Alexander governed fifteen years in the spirit of Vladimir, his father. He died at
Kief in 1455, and was buried in the Catacomb <span class="pageNum" id="pb449">[<a href="#pb449">449</a>]</span>Monastery of that city. His two sons, Simeon and Michael, thought to divide the Kief
region between them, but Kazimir forbade this, adding these words: “Vladimir, your
grandfather, fled to Moscow and deserted his Kief rights.” Still Kazimir gave Kief
to Simeon to govern, and to Michael the younger he left Slutsk and Kopyl as a property.
Simeon ruled in Kief till he died in 1471. After his death, right to Kief went to
Michael, his brother, and to his son Vassili.
</p>
<p>But the Polish king felt so strong now in Western Russia that he determined to give
a blow to the system, and put an end to Kief’s separate existence. Kazimir, remembering
that the Russo-Lithuanian boyars had demanded that he should live in Lithuania at
all times, or send viceroys, indicating Simeon while they did so, not only refused
to give Kief to any son of Alexander, but appointed a viceroy, Martin, son of Gashtold.
The Kief people now refused to admit this man, but Martin brought with him an army,
took Kief by assault, and seated himself in the so-called “Lithuanian castle.”
</p>
<p>Michael, the son of Alexander, was at this time in Novgorod, whither the Boretskis
had called him as Kazimir’s lieutenant. Hearing that his brother Simeon was dead,
he left Novgorod quickly and went to Kief, but finding that Martin was already master
there, he was forced to take Slutsk and Kopyl. This loss of a princedom offended him
deeply.
</p>
<p>Kazimir had adopted the method of Vitold, and was supplanting the princes by his own
men. The princes, of course, did not yield without a struggle. A conspiracy was formed;
at the head of it was Alexander’s son, Michael, and his cousin Feodor Bailski, also
a grandson of Vladimir. The plans of the conspirators have not been made clear to
us; according to some historians, they intended to seize Kazimir, dethrone, or kill
him, and make Michael Grand Prince. According to others, they planned to take possession
of certain eastern districts, and put them under the Grand Prince of Moscow.
</p>
<p>Feodor Bailski, who was marrying a daughter of Alexander Chartoriski, had invited
the king to his wedding. The king went, but the plot was discovered, and Bailski’s
servant, under torture, revealed the whole secret. Bailski, learning of this in the
night, jumped out of bed, and when only half dressed sprang on horseback <span class="pageNum" id="pb450">[<a href="#pb450">450</a>]</span>and galloped away toward the boundary. He reached Moscow in safety, and entered the
service of the Grand Prince. Kazimir kept Bailski’s young wife in Lithuania, and Bailski
found a new wife in Moscow. His associates, Prince Olshanski, and Alexander’s son,
Michael, were seized, brought to trial, and received a death sentence. Straightway
Kazimir confirmed the sentence, which was carried out August, 1482, in front of the
“Lithuanian castle” at Kief.
</p>
<p>Though the conspiracy is involved in deep mystery, both as to details and object,
it is evident that the old order had been given a blow from which it could not recover.
Some princes retained their lands, but those petty rulers, serving superior princes,
were no longer dangerous to political unity. They took high offices willingly, and
very gladly received the incomes going with them. The only danger was from princes
whose lands bordered on Moscow, and who thus had the possibility of joining the capital.
Therefore the Grand Prince of Lithuania tried to hold them by special treaties. Such
treaties proved of small value, however, and toward the end of Kazimir’s reign some
of those princes left Lithuania for Moscow.
</p>
<p>Smolensk was deprived of its old princely stock, and the city was held, through commanders,
as a kind of corner-stone to the Lithuanian state in northeastern regions.
</p>
<p>In the reign of Kazimir&nbsp;IV took place the final separation of the Orthodox Church
in Russia into two parts, the Eastern and Western. Isidor, now in Rome, but whilom
metropolitan of Russia, played his part in this movement. At the wish of Callixtus&nbsp;III
he surrendered to Gregory, his pupil and friend, his right to a part of the Russian
Church, namely, nine bishoprics in Lithuania, Western Russia and Poland, and the former
Patriarch, Gregory Mana, living also in Rome, ordained in 1458 this Gregory as metropolitan
of Kief, Lithuania, and all Western Russia. King Kazimir protected Gregory; but the
Orthodox bishops, and generally the Orthodox people, were so opposed to a metropolitan
from Rome, that Gregory did not go to Kief; he lived mainly in Kazimir’s palace, and
died in 1472 at Novgrodek.
</p>
<p>Two years later the Smolensk bishop, Misail, was made metropolitan. Being opposed
to church union, he received confirmation from Tsargrad, and hence was accepted by
all Western Russians. <span class="pageNum" id="pb451">[<a href="#pb451">451</a>]</span>With him began the unbroken succession of Kief metropolitans, independent of Moscow.
Kief for a second time became the church center of Western Russia, and through the
zeal of the clergy and the people the old city gradually rose again.
</p>
<p>In 1492 Kazimir&nbsp;IV fell ill while visiting Lithuania, and hastened toward Poland;
but he died on the way, at Grodno. In his will he had designated his second son, Yan
Albrecht, to the Polish throne, and Alexander, his third son, to the throne of Lithuania.
The Poles and Lithuanians afterward confirmed each selection.
</p>
<p>During Kazimir’s time rose the Khanate of the Crimea. Information touching the origin
of this Crimean dynasty is obscure and misleading. There is a tradition that the Black
Sea Horde, crushed by civil war, after Edigai’s death chose as Khan a certain Azi,
one of Jinghis Khan’s descendants. In childhood, Azi’s life had been saved in Lithuania,
and he was reared by one Girei, whose name Azi and his family afterward assumed out
of gratitude. Some chronicles describe the accession of the new Khan as happening
in Vitold’s time, and under his auspices; according to others, it took place in the
days of King Kazimir. One thing is clear, that this Azi lived really in Lithuania,
and was descended from Tohtamish, who, as is known, found a refuge in that land.
</p>
<p>According to the second account, when Mongol raids increased against Russia, Kazimir
was advised by his counselors to establish a Khan who might be devoted to Poland,
and opposed to the Golden Horde rulers. So advantage was taken of the tendency to
establish a Mongol state on the Black Sea.
</p>
<p>In 1446 the king sent Azi Girei to the Crimea with a convoy of his own men, commanded
by Radzivill, and on his arrival, the murzas made him Khan. Besides the Crimean populations,
Girei had under him the Nogai Horde, which lived between the Sea of Azoff and the
Dnieper. In general he is considered the real founder of the Khanate. This separation
of the lands along the Black Sea from the Golden Horde on the Volga was attended by
a strife which was increased through inherited hatred between the descendants of Tohtamish
and Kutlui.
</p>
<p>Kutchuk Mohammed was a grandson of Timur Kutlui, and under obligations to King Kazimir
for his election. Azi, or Hadji Girei, remained faithful to the king all his life,
and frequently punished other Mongols for attacking Russo-Lithuanian lands. <span class="pageNum" id="pb452">[<a href="#pb452">452</a>]</span>Especially distinguished for such robber expeditions at that time was Sedi Ahmed,
apparently ruling in the steppes between the Don and the Dnieper. In 1451 Ahmed’s
son, Mazovsha, was sent by him to collect tribute. He reached Moscow in July, and
burned its outskirts, but at the walls of the town his men were defeated by the Russians,
and withdrew in a panic, leaving everything behind them. The following year, while
Sedi Ahmed’s men were making raids in Chernigoff, Girei attacked him suddenly and
crushed his forces. In 1455 he was forced to seek refuge in Lithuania, but was later
captured and imprisoned at Kovno, where he died in confinement.
</p>
<p>The Genoese colonies felt the weight of this Crimean Horde, which extended its lordship
throughout the steppes on the north of the Tauric peninsula, and strove to possess
the southeastern shores of it. They hampered greatly the Genoese, who were at last
forced to declare themselves vassals. The Khan now transferred his residence to Bakche-Sarai
in the Southern Crimea, a city existing to the present day. This first Khan died in
1467.
</p>
<p>The power of the Crimean Khan was limited to a few groups of people. Of these there
were five chief groups: Shirym, Barym, Kuluk, Sulesh, and Mansur, which managed the
destinies of the Khanate. Their influence was felt mainly in choosing each new Khan.
Since the Khans had many sons, the indefiniteness of succession caused dreadful quarrels
and bloodshed. Such struggles were frequent. Girei, who left several sons, was succeeded
by his eldest son, Nordoulat, but Mengli Girei, one of the younger sons, got the throne
later. This renowned Khan more than once experienced the vicissitudes of fortune.
He mounted the throne many times, and was driven from it each time by rivals, but
at last he fixed himself firmly, through the aid of the Osmanli.
</p>
<p>In 1453 the Byzantine Empire fell. The Genoese had given active assistance to the
Empire in its agony, and hence they had suffered severely from Mohammed&nbsp;II, whose
first work was to ravage Galata, the Genoese suburb. In 1475 a strong Turkish fleet
attacked Kaffa (Theodosia). Internal dissensions, treason and the imbecility of the
local power helped the Turks to get possession of the city. Among merchants robbed
and slain were many Muscovites. After this the Turks subjected other Cumean colonies
from Italy. We know not exactly what rôle Girei played in these <span class="pageNum" id="pb453">[<a href="#pb453">453</a>]</span>events; we know that he soon after recognized the Sultan as suzerain, and that Turkish
garrisons were established in various towns on the Black Sea.
</p>
<p>The Crimean Khans, freed recently from subjection to Sarai, fell under the far stronger
grasp of the Osmanli, but Mengli Girei, relying on the Sultan, established himself
firmly, and continued the policy of his father. As to Sarai, he was its worst enemy,
and was ever ready to aid its opponents. He did not, however, carry out his father’s
projects with reference to Lithuania and Poland.
</p>
<p>Never had the Lithuanian state suffered such terrible blows as from Mengli Girei,
in whose day the Crimean Horde received that robber character which for three hundred
years made it famous. It tormented specially Russian regions connected with Poland,
by seizing great numbers of captives, who, forced into slavery, were taken as living
wares to the markets of the Osmanli.
</p>
<p>From the time of Girei, the boundaries of Russia were changed very sensibly. Olgerd
had extended those boundaries into the steppes, and in Vitold’s day they touched the
Euxine. Vitold had striven to guard southern lands from Mongol raids by strengthening
old forts and building new ones. He had fortified Kaneff, and lower down on the Dnieper
he had founded Kremnchug and Cherkasy. On the main crossing of the lower Dnieper he
had fixed outposts. Near the seacoast he had built a strong place where Ochakoff flourished
later, and had made a port near the site of the present Odessa. At the mouth of the
Dniester, fronting Akkerman, he had erected a strong post, and higher up a second,
known later as Bender; besides, there were other posts, in the steppe lands. But the
Russo-Lithuanian state lost these boundaries in the time of the easy-going Kazimir,
who was busied far more with quarreling Diets and the endless debates between Russians
and Poles than with strengthening these boundaries. In his day the Black Sea was lost;
Mengli Girei took possession of those forts built on the steppes and the sea. After
that an immense empty space, known later on as the “Wild Fields,” lay between the
settled Kief lands and the Horde at the Black Sea. These “Wild Fields” became the
battle-ground between Kief colonists and Mongol cut-throats. Kazimir did an evil deed
for his realms and for many men, when he set up Girei as a ruler.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">IVAN&nbsp;III SUBDUES NOVGOROD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On January 22, 1440, Ivan&nbsp;III, son of Vassili the Blind, was born. This future solidifier
of Russia passed his youth in the turmoil and terror of civil dissension, during which
his father was imprisoned and blinded. When restored to power the sightless sovereign
hastened to secure the inheritance to Ivan, making him his associate, with the title
of Grand Prince. By the accounts given us, Ivan, while still a stripling, took active
part in his father’s principality. He campaigned more than once against Mongols, at
first under veteran commanders. At the age of nineteen, he repelled a Horde invasion,
and won a victory of importance. On coming to the throne in 1462, at the age of twenty-two,
he had had much experience both in civil and military labors. His great mental gifts
and exceptional will power were felt soon by all who had to deal with him. Ivan was
cold, imperious and calculating. He acted always on the lines sharply drawn by the
history of Moscow, hence the policy of Russia in his time presented three vital problems:
to consolidate Russia under Moscow; to struggle with the Mongols till Russia should
be free of the humiliating yoke; to settle relations with Lithuania and Poland.
</p>
<p>In consolidating Russia, Ivan’s great achievement was the union of Novgorod, with
all its immense lands, to Moscow. We have seen that Novgorod was declining, and that
Vassili’s expedition in 1456 proved clearly that the end of the Commonwealth was imminent.
Complaints that there was no justice, that the poor suffered from the rich; the hatred
of the poor for those above them; factions; warring parties; want of zeal in those
who governed; the decline of a warlike spirit; love of gain dominating all things;
these taken together proclaimed the approaching downfall. But we must remember also
that the ruling cause was still <span class="pageNum" id="pb455">[<a href="#pb455">455</a>]</span>the power of Moscow and the unavoidable and dominant necessity for Moscow to annex
Novgorod.
</p>
<p>Moscow had reached such strength that Novgorod unassisted could not meet her. Hence
there rose a large party in Novgorod which sought an alliance with Moscow’s main enemy,
Kazimir&nbsp;IV, “the Grand Prince of Lithuania and Russia and King of Poland.” Kazimir’s
Novgorod partisans hoped to find in him a preponderant protector and ally. But the
king was a Catholic, and that turned many men from him. Especially opposed were the
Russian clergy, and among them Iona the archbishop, who enjoyed the love and respect
of the people. Hence only after Iona’s death in 1470 did the Kazimir party set to
work with decision and openly. Nothing shows the decay of the Novgorod Commonwealth
as does the absence of capable men at that period of peril. In that most dangerous
time a woman appeared, who, by energy, ability and devotion to the city, towered above
all her contemporaries. This woman was Martha, the wife of Isaac Boretski, a former
posadnik. Boretski had left much wealth to his widow and his sons, Dmitri and Feodor.
The elder of these sons had been posadnik. Martha, thinking to save the independence
of Novgorod, sought to throw the city into the arms of Kazimir, King of Poland, thus
betraying the cause of Russia, and of Orthodoxy. At her house on the bank of the Volkof,
partisans of an alliance with Kazimir met to feast and discuss means of struggling
against the power of Moscow. As soon as Iona had favored the men of this party by
dying, they summoned a man whom we have mentioned already, namely, a great-grandson
of Olgerd, Michael, son of Alexander, and brother of Simeon, the Kief prince. Michael
came with his personal following. At this time the Kazimir party had, as candidate
for archbishop, Pimen, the key-keeper of the recent archbishop Iona. Pimen, having
had charge of the treasury of the Sophia Cathedral, had taken church money in the
time of Iona and had given it to Martha, for the purchase of partisans. Martha’s adherents,
determined on breaking with Moscow, wished that Iona’s successor should be ordained,
not by Philip, metropolitan of Moscow, but by Gregory of Kief, a pupil of Isidor,
erstwhile metropolitan of Moscow, a man who was looked on as recreant by the Orthodox.
Pimen was willing, but his partisans met failure, and could only make him one of three
candidates. Not on Pimen did the choice <span class="pageNum" id="pb456">[<a href="#pb456">456</a>]</span>fall, but on Feofil. When dispute rose as to who should ordain him, the choice went
to Moscow, and an envoy was sent to the Grand Prince to secure a safe-conduct for
Feofil. Thus the Boretski party was defeated.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile various disputes rose with Moscow. Novgorod men began openly to break the
last treaty. Ivan was thinking of annexation to quell the unruly, and called on Pskoff
to prepare to advance unless the Novgorod people would correct themselves. He received
the Novgorod envoy with favor, and gave a safe-conduct to Feofil.
</p>
<p>The Boretskis began now to kindle dissensions between the boyars and the people, to
rouse men through bribery, drink and persuasion of all kinds. Especially useful was
the report that Ivan was inciting Pskoff against Novgorod. The bells were sounded,
and a mob gathered speedily: “We will not have the Grand Prince of Moscow,” cried
the people, “We will have Kazimir!” The Moscow party, which was composed mainly of
medium and well-to-do people, declared that it was impossible for Orthodox men to
join a king who was a Catholic. From shouts the affair went to blows. The boyar youth
and the mob stoned their opponents and frightened enough of them to secure a majority
at the Assembly. Thus the Boretski party determined in assembly to recognize the Polish
king as Prince of Novgorod, and they sent him an embassy at the head of which were
two former posadniks, Dmitri Boretski, and Afanasi Astafievitch. This embassy concluded
a treaty with Kazimir on almost the same basis as previous treaties with Moscow, adding
only one article, namely: “The king’s representative must be an Orthodox Christian,
and never a Catholic. He must not have more than fifty attendants in Novgorod.”
</p>
<p>When Ivan of Moscow heard of this treaty, he acted with calculation and prudence.
Before he undertook a campaign he sent envoys repeatedly to Novgorod. With them he
sent letters, in which he said that Novgorod had formerly supported Saint Vladimir’s
descendants, and never Lithuanian princes. He invited them to change their plans now,
and promised them favor. At the same time the metropolitan Philip wrote epistles to
the Novgorod people. He counseled them not to betray their religion, not to go over
to the Latins. He pointed to the example of the Byzantine Empire, <span class="pageNum" id="pb457">[<a href="#pb457">457</a>]</span>which remained strong while it clung to its religion, but fell under Turks when it
turned to the Latins. He wrote also to the clergy, boyars and merchants, beseeching
them to stand firmly for the Orthodox faith, and restrain men from all evil courses.
</p>
<p>Thus Moscow touched the most sensitive chord in the Russians, and for the first time
gave that alliance of Novgorod with Kazimir the aspect of treason. These remonstrances
influenced a great many people. The Boretskis, however, were more active and determined
than most men, and outshouting all others, they declared: “We are not an inheritance
of Moscow! We are free! We are for the king!”
</p>
<p>War was now unavoidable. Great disasters, according to popular belief, are preceded
by wonders. The fall of Novgorod had also its admonishing marvels: A storm broke the
cross on St. Sophia. Blood appeared on the graves of two archbishops whom the people
had loved. In the Hutin monastery a bell sounded, though no man rang it. In the church
of Yevfimia tears dropped from the eyes of an image of the Virgin. A holy hermit went
to Novgorod to a feast at the mansion of Martha; all at once, while sitting at the
table, he became terrified. At the moment he did not speak of it, but afterward he
explained to an anchoret that among the boyars present he had seen some who appeared
to be headless, and he mentioned their names. Later the heads of those same boyars
were cut off in the struggle with the Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>Ivan, calculating every step carefully, acted with decision and with unbending resolve
against Novgorod. At first he took counsel with his mother, the metropolitan Philip,
and intimate boyars. They advised him to trust in God firmly, to advance against Novgorod
and punish it for its treason. After this small, or preliminary council, he summoned
a great one, at which appeared his brothers, the bishops of Russia, the subordinate
princes, boyars, voevodas, and nobles. Explaining to them the disobedience and treason
of Novgorod, he asked: “Shall I march against the place straightway?”
</p>
<p>Summer was coming, and the Novgorod country abounded in rivers, lakes, swamps and
morasses; former Grand Princes rarely made the march during summer, but the great
council, like the small one, decided to confide in the Lord and the Holy Virgin, and
<span class="pageNum" id="pb458">[<a href="#pb458">458</a>]</span>march with all promptness, making a holy war against the allies of the Pope and the
Poles.
</p>
<p>On this, as on every occasion, appeared the old rivalry of Novgorod and Suzdal, and
the perfect sympathy of Moscow with the consolidation of Russia, under the leadership
of its Grand Prince. To this was now added great indignation at Novgorod, for deserting
its Orthodox connections. Resting on this sympathy, which even rose to enthusiasm,
Ivan sent general commands to move against the city. Notice was given to Novgorod,
and troops were requested of Tver and Pskoff. Ivan ordered the campaign as follows:
He despatched the boyar, Boris Slaipets, to Vyatka, to attack the Dvina region with
warriors from Vyatka. Vassili Obrazets, the Ustyug voevoda, was to join him. To Novgorod,
Ivan sent two divisions, one under Holmski with orders to march against Russa and
then, joining Pskoff forces, to attack Novgorod’s western boundary; another, under
Striga <span class="corr" id="xd32e3741" title="Source: Obolinski">Obolenski</span>, was to attack on the east side. The Grand Prince himself, after giving large alms
and praying at the grave of his father, received a blessing from the metropolitan,
and on June 20 marched out of Moscow with the main army. With him went Stephen Vorobati,
a man deeply read in Russian chronicles, who could remind Novgorod of all its former
treaties.
</p>
<p>Ivan left Moscow to the care of two of his brothers, and took three with him. At Torjok
the Tver forces joined him.
</p>
<p>Nature itself seemed to favor the expedition. The summer was unaccountably dry; every
soft place had become passable. Warriors and wagons moved over ground on which ordinarily
no one could go at that season of the year.
</p>
<p>How did Novgorod meet these men moving from three sides? All hope in Kazimir was illusive.
Drawn off by other questions, the king took no part whatever in the war between Novgorod
and Moscow. Prince Michael, the son of Alexander, who might have helped, received
news of the death of his brother, and left immediately, taking his troops with him.
He passed through the country like an enemy, extorting taxes with violence, and robbing
towns till he touched the boundary.
</p>
<p>There was in Novgorod another man hostile to Moscow, Prince Shuiski, a descendant
of those Suzdal princes who had lost their lands somewhat earlier. Shuiski was despatched
to the Dvina. <span class="pageNum" id="pb459">[<a href="#pb459">459</a>]</span>The envoys seeking Pskoff aid received nothing; for the Pskoff men had already yielded
to Moscow’s demands, and sent troops to act against Novgorod. Obliged to depend upon
their own strength and resources, the Novgorod men did not falter. They equipped a
considerable army, and noting Ivan’s blunder in strategy, took advantage of it. His
troops, though numerous, were scattered, and were advancing along various roads, without
much precaution. The city thought to defeat them in detail by acting with swiftness,
and by concentrating forces.
</p>
<p>The Novgorod troops marched at once against Holmski, who had taken and burned Russa,
and was advancing slowly, while waiting for Pskoff men. Their plan was to crush Holmski
before he could be reinforced by the Pskoff army, and then to rout the latter. Meanwhile,
the Novgorod horse were moving along the west bank of Lake Ilmen. A part of the warriors
had debarked on its southern border, near Korostyno, but the Moscow guard noted this
movement quickly, and despatched couriers to Holmski, who struck on the Novgorod foot
at once. They fought bravely, but were scattered, because the horsemen, though near,
could not help them. The troops sent by the archbishop excused themselves, saying:
“We were sent against Pskoff, and not to fight Moscow.” The victors learned also that
Novgorod forces, embarked at the mouth of the Pola, were sailing toward Russa, so
the Moscow men turned to this town and dispersed the warriors who landed there, thus
baffling Novgorod’s plan against Holmski. The Novgorod infantry was scattered and
crushed, but the cavalry was uninjured and numerous, forty thousand in all, as reckoned
by Moscow, while Holmski’s division was less than one fourth of that number.
</p>
<p>The Moscow voevodas laid siege to Deman, the town nearest Russa, not wishing to leave
it behind them. But the Grand Prince, on hearing of victory, sent them to Sheloni,
where they joined Pskoff men; and to Deman he sent Prince Vereiski. At Sheloni Prince
Holmski found the Novgorod horse on the opposite bank of the river. They intended
apparently to fall on the Pskoff men, who had at last entered Novgorod regions, and
were plundering and taking everything before them.
</p>
<p>Seeing the preponderance on their side, the Novgorod men, keeping up the old custom,
began to boast of their strength, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb460">[<a href="#pb460">460</a>]</span>ridicule their opponents. The sight of this well-armed and active body confused the
Moscow troops somewhat, but only for a moment. They had made many campaigns, and were
under trained leaders, while the defenders of the city were potters, carpenters and
tanners, who had hurried to arms quickly under threat of losing their houses, or being
drowned in the river. If they were trained it was only in boxing, or fighting with
bludgeons, not in handling sharp weapons and horses. Obedience and concord were wholly
unknown to them, and they had no experienced leaders.
</p>
<p>When the Moscow voevodas reached the ford, they cried to those under them, “Brothers,
it is better for us to lay down our lives with honor than to go back defeated.” With
these words they urged their horses down the steep bank, and were the first to plunge
into the river. After them rushed the whole army, wading and swimming to the opposite
side, and with shouts of “Moscow! Moscow!” they hurled themselves against the enemy.
</p>
<p>The city men, answering with “Holy Sophia!” “Great Novgorod!” rushed to the onset.
The Moscow troops had a difficult task before them, but the attackers showed judgment;
they struck mainly the horses. Thus, though the Novgorod men struggled desperately,
the men of Moscow were overcoming them, for the rearing and plunging of their wounded
beasts caused dreadful confusion in the ranks. Then a division attacked their rear,
and this gave a decisive victory to Moscow.
</p>
<p>A large number of Novgorod men fell or were captured; the remainder rushed wildly
through forests or galloped home to the city. Among the captives were many boyars
and some former posadniks; with these men were the sons of Martha Boretski.
</p>
<p>The treaty between King Kazimir and Novgorod was found in the deserted camp and sent
to the Grand Prince, together with news of the triumph. The Moscow camp was filled
with delight and rejoicing. Ivan moved now to Russa, and there the captives were brought
to receive judgment. The prisoners of importance he met with stern severity. Of those
who would have given Novgorod to Kazimir four were beheaded: Dmitri Boretski, Vassili
Selezneff, Yeremi Suhoscheka, and Cyprian Arbuzieff. Other notable persons, among
them Vassili Kazimir and Matthew Selezen, were removed to Kolomna and kept there in
irons; still <span class="pageNum" id="pb461">[<a href="#pb461">461</a>]</span>others he sentenced to imprisonment in Moscow; unimportant people were dismissed to
their families.
</p>
<p>From Russa, Ivan moved toward the mouth of the Sheloni. Meanwhile Holmski conquered
all the west to the German boundary.
</p>
<p>Moscow troops were now approaching Novgorod from various directions, to force the
people to open the gates to them. Chaos reigned in the city. There was heard on all
sides the wail of widows and orphans mourning for the men who had perished. The Boretskis,
however, encouraged the people, and roused them to desperate effort. On the walls
and the towers guards were changed frequently, both night and day. The defenders burned
monasteries and houses near the city. A courier was sent to King Kazimir, imploring
his immediate assistance. But the courier came back soon. The Livonian Grand Master
had barred the way to him. Meanwhile a certain Upadysh had spiked guns on the walls
of the city and straightway had suffered death for treason. Great numbers of people
had come from the country to Novgorod; and now disease appeared. Communication with
the world was interrupted, and hunger was approaching. To complete the disaster, evil
news came from Dvina regions: The voevodas of Moscow had scattered the Novgorod army;
Prince Shuiski, its leader, was wounded severely; the inhabitants had taken the oath
to the Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>The Novgorod adherents of peace and alliance with Moscow attacked the opponents for
listening to women and destroying the Commonwealth. The Assembly sent envoys to Ivan.
From the five ends of the city went five notable persons, and five ex-posadniks. At
the head of those ten was the archbishop. The envoys sailed over the Ilmen to Korostyno,
but were not admitted at once to an audience. When the Grand Prince saw them, the
archbishop asked him to give pardon to Novgorod, and not take its territory.
</p>
<p>Ivan listened kindly, and agreed to stop bloodshed. The question of peace he committed
to boyars. August 9 and 11, 1471, papers were signed by which Ivan seemed to acknowledge
the old-time conditions, and almost repeat the peace clauses framed by Vassili, his
father. To these was added only the bond not to join Lithuania deceitfully and to
have the archbishop ordained <span class="pageNum" id="pb462">[<a href="#pb462">462</a>]</span>always in Moscow, at the tomb of the first metropolitan, Peter. The Grand Prince returned
the towns won from the city and its districts. Novgorod agreed to pay an indemnity
of fifteen thousand five hundred rubles. Ivan’s voevoda was to take the oath from
all Novgorod to observe this new treaty. After the oath had been given, Ivan went
to Moscow.
</p>
<p>Thus the Grand Prince conquered Novgorod, sparing it this first time, and seeming
not to entirely deprive it of independence. With his usual caution, he did not bring
men to despair; he left his final blow for another day. A wise man might have foreseen
easily that such a day was inevitable, and in the near future. Ivan had the strength
to wait for it.
</p>
<p>How pleasing and how popular the victory was in Moscow was shown by the welcome which
that city gave the Grand Prince at his coming. People in thousands went a number of
versts from the city to greet him. The metropolitan and the clergy met him with banners
and crosses. His son and attendants were waiting one day’s journey from the city.
</p>
<p>While men of Moscow were rejoicing in this way, an evil fate seemed to frown upon
Novgorod. After all the reverses and plunders a new misfortune came to that place.
Among people from outside who had fled to the city were families from Russa. After
peace was made, they took boats and were sailing homeward by Lake Ilmen when a dreadful
tempest rose and drowned nearly all of them. It is said that seven thousand died in
the water. In Novgorod itself there were fires which raged with great havoc.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h2 class="main">DOWNFALL OF THE HORDE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In 1471 Feofil, the archbishop, was anointed in Moscow, and obtained from the Grand
Prince release for boyars in detention. The next year Ivan married Sophia Palaeologus,
a niece of Constantine, the last Emperor of Constantinople. Ivan’s first wife, Maria,
a Tver princess, had died six years earlier. When the Turks captured Tsargrad, in
1453, the younger brothers of the Emperor, Dmitri and Thomas, were despots or rulers
in Negropont, but instead of helping each other, they exhausted their forces in fighting,
and in 1460 their possessions fell to the Osmanli. Dmitri yielded to <span class="corr" id="xd32e3783" title="Source: Mahommed">Mohammed</span>&nbsp;II, gave him a daughter for his harem, and lived upon Mussulman bounty. But Thomas,
a prouder and more determined man than his brother, left his wife in Corfu, and journeyed
to Rome, thinking to find there not merely a refuge, but aid to win back his dominion.
</p>
<p>The papal throne was then held by the well-known Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, who was
Pope Pius&nbsp;II. He received very cordially this Palaeologus, who had remained faithful
to the Florentine union, and assigned him a generous pension. Thomas brought to the
Pope a most precious relic: the head of Saint Andrew, which was met with great honor
by the clergy and placed in St. Peter’s. To this relic the former despot added another:
the hand of John the Baptist. Pius&nbsp;II now announced a crusade to expel the Osmanli,
and wished to take personal part in it, but death struck him soon, and Palaeologus
himself died the following year, 1465, while waiting for his family, which had already
reached Ancona.
</p>
<p>His eldest child, Helena, a widow of Lazar&nbsp;II, the Serbian king, retired to a convent;
two sons, and Zoe (Sophia), a daughter, still remained. They settled in Rome under
papal protection. By <span class="pageNum" id="pb464">[<a href="#pb464">464</a>]</span>the will of their father their guardian was Vissarion, that cardinal who, after Isidor’s
death, was made titular Patriarch of Tsargrad. He had the young men and their sister
reared carefully, and strove to inspire them with attachment, not to church union
alone, but to the Latin Church specially. Princess Sophia had not passed out of childhood
when both the Pope and Vissarion were seeking a husband for her among princely houses
in Italy, and elsewhere. But those efforts ended unsuccessfully, partly because the
girl had no dowry, and partly because of intriguing.
</p>
<p>Vissarion’s attention rested at last on Ivan of Moscow. It was no great task to incline
the Pope toward this marriage. It is known that the Curia strove to bring Russia to
its spiritual guidance whenever a chance came. What Isidor had not accomplished, that
is, the union of the Churches, the Pope now planned to effect through Sophia. Moreover
he saw in Ivan fresh aid against the Osmanli.
</p>
<p>Ivan was pleased with this marriage into a house with which he was related already,—his
aunt, Anna, the sister of his father, had been wife of John, the eldest brother of
Thomas Palaeologus. Sixtus&nbsp;IV, Pope at that time, received very graciously the envoys
who came for the bride and brought rich presents. The chief of these envoys was Giovanni
Battista Volpe of the city of Vicenza, who, employed at the mint, lived in Moscow,
and was known there as Ivan Friazine. The Pope and the Sacred College spoke to the
envoys as if the Russian Church had joined the Florentine union already. Sixtus, like
those who preceded him, thought to drive out the Osmanli, and had formed a league
to that end, both with Naples and Venice. In May he blessed banners for that enterprise,
and three days later the marriage of Sophia was solemnized in the Basilica of St.
Peter. Then Sophia and her suite and Ivan Friazine, who represented the Grand Prince,
were sent on their way accompanied by the papal legate, Antonio, to whom, as it seems,
was committed the task of establishing the Florentine union in Russia.
</p>
<p>They journeyed through Italy and Germany to Lubeck, where they took ship, and after
sailing eleven days on the Baltic, reached Revel; thence they passed through Pskoff
and Novgorod to Moscow. The legate, Antonio, in a red robe and hat, and wearing red
gloves which he never removed, had a crucifix borne before him as he passed through
the cities. He made no sign of the cross <span class="pageNum" id="pb465">[<a href="#pb465">465</a>]</span>in Orthodox churches, and kissed no images, as did Sophia and those who were with
her. This roused much scandal among Orthodox people, who remembered the Latin apostasy
of Isidor. Reports of these facts reached Moscow and the council at once considered
how to act with the legate. Ivan sought advice from the metropolitan, Philip, who
answered that if Antonio entered Moscow with the crucifix at one gate, he would leave
the city directly by another gate. That he who honors a strange faith belittles the
faith of his own land. Ivan sent a boyar to have the legate hide the cross in his
equipage, and after some opposition Antonio yielded to this request. The marriage
took place the day of Sophia’s arrival.
</p>
<p>For form’s sake, it was needful to make some decision regarding Antonio, whose special
mission it was to unite the two Churches. They arranged a discussion between him and
Philip, who called in Nikita, a man of deep reading, who, if we credit the chronicle,
talked with such wisdom that the legate was forced to declare that he had not the
books which he needed. In every case he soon saw that there was no chance of union.
Still he remained eleven weeks in Moscow, after which Ivan dismissed him with honor.
The envoys who had come with Sophia from her brothers returned to Rome also. The Grand
Prince sent gifts of great value to the Pope, and also to Sophia’s brothers. Ivan,
related by this marriage to the Greek and Roman Cæsars, now adopted the double eagle
for the arms of Russia, still to be seen in its archaic form in the “Palais à Facettes”
of the Kremlin. His seal bore on one side an eagle, on the other a horseman trampling
a dragon. On this seal was the inscription “Grand Prince by the Grace of God, Sovereign
of Russia.”
</p>
<p>The confidence of Rome in Sophia was baseless. She carried from Rome, as seems evident,
ideas not touching on gratitude, and had bitter memories of what she had passed through
in many ways. On her long journey to Moscow she had time to think over her position,
and was no doubt advised by the keen Greeks who accompanied her. Ivan Friazine himself,
who knew the Grand Prince very well, might have opened her eyes in church matters.
Sophia not only rejected the union in which she had been reared, but adhered to the
Orthodox Church very firmly. She was a woman of strong character, and bore the Mongol
yoke with impatience. <span class="pageNum" id="pb466">[<a href="#pb466">466</a>]</span>Having great influence over Ivan, she incited him continually to struggle against
its oppression.
</p>
<p>We must now turn to Novgorod. The late war and peace with Ivan had greatly intensified
the conflict of parties. Popular government, which had existed for centuries in that
Commonwealth, had lost the best points of its character. No matter how unequal were
the powers in this struggle with Moscow, only a cracked and shattered system could
be so weak as was Novgorod. The boyars, freed from Moscow detention, strengthened
the Boretski adherents, who began promptly to pour out their hatred of Moscow on Moscow
adherents. The struggle was limited no longer to mob meetings; violence began, and
whole streets were plundered. Once a number of boyars, with the city posadnik, Anani,
as their leader, assembled a party of followers, and attacked two streets, wounding
and robbing their enemies who lived there. Another time Panfil, an elder, with boyars,
and a party of similar character, broke into the houses of other boyars, beat their
servants, and bore off much property. When such were the acts of men in authority,
whose duty it was to keep order, it is clear that there was anarchy in Novgorod. The
opponents of the widow and her sons could find no <span class="corr" id="xd32e3804" title="Source: pretection">protection</span> at home; hence they turned to the Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>Ivan delayed not in making his answer. Setting out in the autumn of 1475 with a large
armed attendance, he sent a courier in advance with the tidings that he was on the
way to his inheritance, Great Novgorod. Barely had he entered the lands of the city
when people came forth with complaints of oppression. Later on boyars and men of importance
received him with presents, as did the archbishop, Prince Shuiski, the posadnik, and
others.
</p>
<p>November 21, the Grand Prince arrived at the Gorodische, and went to mass there. On
the twenty-third he entered Novgorod officially, and prayed in Sophia Cathedral. He
dined with the archbishop and returned to the Gorodische. His military forces found
lodgings in monasteries.
</p>
<p>The unexpected arrival of the Grand Prince confused the partisans of Kazimir. They
were silent and tried to rival their opponents in hospitality to Ivan. The Grand Prince
dined once with Prince Shuiski, and thrice with the archbishop. He feasted once at
the house of the former posadnik; he dined also with the commander and with notable
boyars. At each house many casks <span class="pageNum" id="pb467">[<a href="#pb467">467</a>]</span>of wine from “beyond the sea,” mead in barrels, rich cloth, foreign gold, tusks of
walrus, trained falcons, sables, horses, gold goblets filled with pearls, horns mounted
in silver, and silver dishes, were presented to him. It is evident that Novgorod men
did their best to surpass one another.
</p>
<p>But the stern widow did not bend to the Grand Prince. Martha Boretski offered neither
hospitality nor presents. The former posadniks, merchants, and rich men, who did not
succeed in feasting Ivan, came to him with gifts and with homage. The posadnik and
the commander brought one thousand rubles from the city. Ivan gave a banquet himself,
to which Prince Shuiski, the posadnik, many merchants, and wealthy persons were invited.
The Grand Prince sat long at table with his guests, gave them fine garments, rich
goblets, sabres, and horses.
</p>
<p>But feasting did not draw Ivan from the object of his coming. He received Novgorod
complainants who sought for redress of injustice. Touching the street attack by boyars,
Ivan commanded to arrest the chief offenders, the posadnik Vassili Anani, and the
boyars Bogdan Osipoff, Feodor Boretski, and Ivan Lashinski. In accordance with Novgorod
rule, Ivan required the Assembly to attach its own officers with his to the defendants.
The comrades of those offenders were freed on the archbishop’s recognizance in the
sum of fifteen hundred rubles.
</p>
<p>After the case had been examined, Ivan rendered judgment against the defendants. On
the archbishop’s security they were freed from imprisonment, but had to pay fifteen
hundred rubles indemnity to the injured, and a fine to the Grand Prince. The four
main criminals, despite all petitions, were sent under guard and in fetters to Moscow.
</p>
<p>After a stay of nine weeks, Ivan went back to Moscow. Besides the four boyars, he
gave command to arrest Ivan Afonasoff and his son, Olferi, because they had plotted
to surrender Novgorod to King Kazimir. From Moscow the condemned boyars were sent
to Kolomna and to Murom.
</p>
<p>Thus Ivan seized the chief leaders of Kazimir’s party, and gave Novgorod an example
of his justice, which punished men without reference to wealth or position.
</p>
<p>Novgorod men, finding no protection at home, went to Moscow with complaints against
powerful offenders. The Grand Prince <span class="pageNum" id="pb468">[<a href="#pb468">468</a>]</span>then summoned those offenders to his capital, a thing never done up to his day. Among
the complainants and offenders to be met in Moscow were Novgorod men of distinction,—for
example, a former posadnik, Zahari Ovin, and the boyar, Vassili Nikifor. The latter,
though a leader of the Kazimir party, gave an oath of some kind to the Grand Prince.
Many members of the party, considering their cause lost, passed to the other side.
The adherents of Moscow had now grown so confident that, with the archbishop as their
leader, they acted with decision.
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1477 there came to the Grand Prince a document from the archbishop
and all Novgorod. In this document the Grand Prince was called Gosudar (sovereign),
and not Gospodin (lord), as had been the case up to that day. Ivan somewhat later
sent as envoys to Novgorod two boyars to ask what kind of “Gosudarstvo” (sovereignty)
Novgorod men wanted. The Moscow envoys appeared before the Assembly and asked if Novgorod
men, having called Ivan sovereign, would yield now the Yaroslav court to him, have
his representatives on all streets, and leave his judges in freedom. The people were
stunned by these questions. The majority shouted at the envoys, said their statement
was a falsehood, and declared that the Assembly had never called Ivan a sovereign,
that no document had ever been sent to him with that word in it.
</p>
<p>Kazimir’s party hastened now to rouse public rage against Moscow. A furious storm
rose immediately. The people remembered those boyars who had gone to the Grand Prince
for justice. They seized Nikifor and Ovin; they brought them to the Assembly and questioned
them. Ovin, to protect himself, accused Nikifor. “Falsifier!” shouted the people to
Nikifor, “thou hast kissed the cross to the Grand Prince!” “I kissed the cross to
serve with truth, and wish well to him, but I kissed no cross against Great Novgorod,
my sovereign, or against you, my dear gentlemen.” Thereupon Nikifor was chopped into
small bits with axes. Ovin did not save himself either. They killed him with Kuzma,
his brother, at the archbishop’s palace.
</p>
<p>Some other boyars, in dread of a similar fate, hurried off to the Grand Prince. Their
houses were ransacked, and gutted, and their property taken. The unrestrained mob
gave itself up to various excesses. Again were heard shouts: “We are for the <span class="pageNum" id="pb469">[<a href="#pb469">469</a>]</span>king!” But no man harmed the envoys of Moscow, and they were sent back to Ivan with
this answer: “We salute you lord, but sovereign we have not called you. Your court
is to be as before in the Gorodische. But your representatives are not to be with
us, and Yaroslav’s court we will not surrender to you. We will carry out our agreement
made at Korostyno. As to him who without our consent called you sovereign, punish
him as may please you; we will execute every man whom we find guilty in this case.”
</p>
<p>Thus the question of sovereign remained unexplained. The chronicler leaves it indefinite,
and does not state whether a document was sent from the Assembly in that sense, or
was used only by the archbishop and certain boyars.
</p>
<p>Ivan complained now to the metropolitan, to boyars, and to his own mother, that the
Novgorod men refused to adhere to their statement, that they represented him as untruthful
and insulted him; that they plundered and killed persons faithful to Moscow. After
he had judged the affair with the aid of a council, composed of the higher clergy
and the boyars, the Grand Prince resolved on a new expedition against Novgorod, and
immediately sent couriers to summon forces. He asked Tver, and Pskoff also, for aid.
Prayers were held in all churches, and liberal gifts made to them, and to monasteries.
</p>
<p>In the latter part of September, 1478, Ivan sent to Novgorod a declaration of war,
and on October 9 he set out with his army. Marching through Tver territory, he arrived
ten days later at Torjok, where a Moscow lieutenant, Vassili Kitai, was stationed.
There he was met by two envoys who had come from Novgorod to obtain a safe-conduct
for an embassy to negotiate; this the Grand Prince refused. In Torjok the auxiliary
Tver troops were waiting with others. Ivan had planned well his campaign, and advanced
with rapidity. As he approached Novgorod, boyars, merchants, and wealthy men came
begging for admission to his service. They recognized the futility of struggling with
Moscow, and passed to the victor in season.
</p>
<p>On reaching Lake Ilmen, Ivan divided his army into four parts. The first was commanded
by his brother, Andrei Menshoi, and others; on the right wing was his brother, Andrei
Bolshoi, the Tver voevoda, and Prince Michael; on the left wing was his <span class="pageNum" id="pb470">[<a href="#pb470">470</a>]</span>brother, Boris, and in the center, where he himself was, was Prince Patrikaieff. He
sent a part of the army to take possession of the Gorodische, and also of the monasteries,
before any one could burn them. This was done successfully. The rest of the army laid
siege to the city. In Ivan’s first campaign a dry summer had assisted, but the time
was now winter, hence the troops could go anywhere freely; lakes, rivers and morasses
were solid. The Grand Prince and his men marched on the ice of Lake Ilmen and halted
three versts from Novgorod, at the village of the boyar Lashinski. Not relying on
frost alone, Ivan built a bridge over the Volkoff, thus ensuring connection with all
the parts of his army.
</p>
<p>What could the city do against this dreadful power which beset it on all sides? In
the first war with Moscow the city had considerable forces, but now we find them not
even attempting to fight in the open. Every energy was turned to defending the walls
and the fortress. They tried at first to strengthen these defenses, and even made
a strong wooden wall near the new bridge. If Ivan had attacked without waiting, he
might have found much resistance, and would have lost, it may be, many warriors; but
he was not in a hurry. He calculated on how long Novgorod could resist in this difficult
position. It was not without reason that during the first war, and after it, Ivan
had seized the most active and capable leaders opposed to him. There was not one weighty
person now among the leaders; and it would have been very difficult for any man of
power to appear in the anarchy which was raging in the city at that time. Assistance
from outside was impossible. No aid came from Kazimir. One method alone was left open
to Novgorod people: negotiations with the conqueror. They could only bargain for conditions
as best as they were able, and then beg for mercy. In fact the chronicler in describing
this campaign touches mainly on this point.
</p>
<p>Novgorod had sent to Torjok to obtain from Ivan a safe-conduct for envoys. He commanded
to detain the first messenger. They sent then a second, and a third man. Only on November
8, when thirty versts from the city, did Ivan give safe-conduct. An embassy of ten,
with the archbishop as leader, then came to him. The archbishop rendered homage to
Ivan, calling him sovereign, and Grand Prince of all Russia, in the name of the abbots,
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb471">[<a href="#pb471">471</a>]</span>priests, and all the seven churches of Novgorod. He asked him to be gracious to his
inheritance, to put away sword and fire, and to restore to the city those boyars who
had been taken to Moscow. After the archbishop, other members of the embassy spoke
in the same sense. The request to free a few boyars taken to Moscow was ill-timed,
when the very existence of the city was in peril. Feodor, an envoy, added a request
that the Grand Prince would command his boyars to discuss conditions of peace with
them.
</p>
<p>Ivan made no answer, but invited the envoys to dine with him. Next day he appointed
Prince Patrikaieff and two boyars, the brothers Borisovitch, to talk with those envoys.
As was the wont of that time, the Novgorod envoys divided the articles for discussion:
One man asked that the Grand Prince be gracious to Great Novgorod, his heritage, set
aside wrath, and sheathe the sword; another asked that the boyars detained in Moscow
should be liberated; a third proposed that the sovereign should come to Novgorod not
oftener than once in four years, take one thousand rubles each visit, and whatever
his lieutenant and posadnik could not judge he should judge on his coming, and not
summon Novgorod men to Moscow for trial. A fourth requested that the lieutenant of
the Grand Prince should not interfere in the courts of the archbishop and posadnik.
It was asked also that servants of the Grand Prince be judged not in the Gorodische,
but in the city. In conclusion it was requested that the Grand Prince declare why
it was that Novgorod should give homage.
</p>
<p>All these questions were laid before Ivan. On the following day, at his order an answer
was given, also in sections. Prince Patrikaieff made a general introduction, then
the other two boyars continued. Touching Novgorod’s denial as to using the word “sovereign,”
by this denial, they said, Novgorod had given the lie to Ivan and insulted him. The
Grand Prince was astounded that the archbishop and the envoys asked freedom for men
then detained for robbery and violence. In conclusion, Prince Patrikaieff added that
if Great Novgorod wished to do homage to the Grand Prince, it knew for what it was
to do homage. The envoys were dismissed with this answer.
</p>
<p>December 4 the archbishop and envoys returned. They expressed Novgorod’s regret for
having denied the word “Gosudar.” Then followed Ivan’s answer: “If ye acknowledge
your fault <span class="pageNum" id="pb472">[<a href="#pb472">472</a>]</span>and ask what rule there is to be in our heritage, Great Novgorod, our answer is: We
wish the same government in Novgorod as in Moscow.” The envoys departed. December
7 the archbishop came with the same envoys and five other men. They begged that the
Grand Prince’s lieutenant should judge with the posadnik. They proposed an annual
tax of half a silver grieven for each plow. “Let the Grand Prince rule the dependent
cities of Novgorod through lieutenants; but not remove men from Novgorod territory,
or take the lands of boyars, and not summon men from Novgorod to Moscow, or make them
serve in the Lower Country.”
</p>
<p>The Grand Prince answered through the boyars: “I have said that I wish the same rule
in Novgorod as in Moscow, and now ye point out to me how to act. How would that be
my rule?” After that they begged him to explain his will, since they knew not how
he ruled the “Lower Country.” The Novgorod boyars knew well what Moscow rule was,
but they feared the final word, and feigned not to understand the discussion. At last
the sentence was pronounced by Ivan through his boyars: “Our rule is this: There is
to be neither Assembly nor posadnik in Novgorod. We are to have the whole government,
and the districts and villages are to be managed as in the Lower Country.”
</p>
<p>This answer was like a thunderbolt, but was softened somewhat by the promise not to
remove people from Novgorod, or touch the inheritance of the boyars, and to leave
courts in their present condition.
</p>
<p>They discussed the words of the Grand Prince a whole week in the city at stormy meetings.
Finally the party of moderate men and the adherents of Moscow triumphed. They sent
the same envoys to say that the Assembly and the posadnik were abolished. But they
repeated their petition touching land, and the removal of people from Novgorod, that
is, a summons to Moscow, and service in the Lower Country.
</p>
<p>It is clear that the Novgorod boyars had sacrificed their government, and were working
then for class interests only. The Grand Prince granted their requests, but when the
envoys asked an oath from him he refused sharply. They asked then that his boyars
take an oath. This was refused also. They begged that his future lieutenant take the
oath. This was not granted. Moreover, Ivan detained the envoys in his camp a whole
fortnight. <span class="pageNum" id="pb473">[<a href="#pb473">473</a>]</span>He wished to weary the Novgorod men, and bring them to perfect agreement. He knew
that there was a large party that still opposed him, and cried out at all meetings
that they must fight Moscow to the uttermost.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile supplies in the city were exhausted; hunger began, and, as many people from
the country had taken refuge in the place, the plague appeared. There was great abundance
in the Moscow camp, and Ivan commanded Pskoff merchants to sell flour, fish and bread
to the people. Disturbance and quarrels between the desperate opponents of Moscow
and its adherents were unceasing. The Moscow side triumphed, however, and made further
resistance impossible. The chief voevoda in Novgorod, Prince Shuiski, renounced his
oath to the city. Going out unopposed, two days later, to the camp of the Grand Prince,
he entered his service.
</p>
<p>On the twenty-ninth Ivan summoned the Novgorod envoys to confirm all conditions, and
then dismissed them. Barely had they gone from his presence, however, when the boyars
stopped them, declaring that the sovereign demanded towns and villages, otherwise
he could not manage Novgorod. They had to pass many times between the Moscow camp
and the city before this question was settled.
</p>
<p>Novgorod offered two districts adjoining Lithuania, then ten districts belonging to
the archbishop, and the monasteries; but Ivan would not take these. Then they asked
that he say himself what he wanted. He demanded one half of the districts of the archbishop
and the monasteries, and all Torjok districts, no matter to whom they belonged. The
Assembly at last agreed to this, but asked that half the land be taken from the six
chief monasteries, and that the land of the others, which were needy, should not be
taken.
</p>
<p>Ivan consented, and when, at his command, a detailed list of all the districts was
given, he showed favor to the archbishop, and took not one half of his land, but only
a tenth of the best districts. When the question was settled the envoys begged Ivan
to lighten the siege, during which many people were perishing. He did not hasten to
answer, and commanded his boyars to talk about the annual tax on all Novgorod. After
long discussion, Ivan made it half a silver grieven for every plow of each land-tiller.
At the <span class="pageNum" id="pb474">[<a href="#pb474">474</a>]</span>same time, at request of the bishop, he agreed not to send his own scribes, or listers,
lest they might burden the people. He would depend, he said, on the faith of the Novgorod
men, who might collect the whole tax and deliver it to whomever command should be
given to receive it. When these conditions had all been accepted, Ivan ordered to
clear the Yaroslav court for himself, and drew up an oath paper for all Novgorod.
This paper was signed by the archbishop, who put his seal on it, together with the
seals of the five ends of Novgorod, and January 15, 1478, the five Moscow boyars,
who had finished negotiations, were sent to the city to take the oath from all people.
</p>
<p>Thenceforth the Assembly existed no longer. The higher classes, that is the boyars,
rich people and merchants, took oath in the bishop’s palace. And to the five ends
of the city were sent from the Grand Prince officials who brought all common men to
the oath of allegiance. Then the Novgorod boyars, boyars’ sons, and wealthy people
asked the Grand Prince to take them into service. This he consented to do with the
obligation on their part to inform of the good and evil planned by any of the Novgorod
men, with relation to the Grand Prince of Moscow.
</p>
<p>Only on January 18 did Ivan permit the country people, who had gathered in the city
for safety, to go home, and on January 29 he entered Novgorod to hear mass, but returned
to camp, as there was plague in the city. He remained about three weeks longer, arranging
affairs of all kinds. At the Yaroslav court, instead of an Assembly, were Ivan’s two
lieutenants, Prince Striga Obolenski and his brother. On the Sophia side of the city
Ivan appointed two boyars, Vassili Kitai and Ivan Zinovieff. These four men were to
govern the city and give judgment instead of the former posadniks and commanders.
Then, not limiting himself by the pardon given Novgorod men, the Grand Prince commanded
to seize a number of the leaders of the party opposed to him among boyars and wealthy
persons; these men he sent to Moscow and confiscated their property. Among the persons
taken was the renowned widow, Martha Boretski, with her grandson, Vassili,—the son
of Feodor,—who died later on in confinement at Murom, after he had taken the monk’s
habit.
</p>
<p>Ivan left Novgorod, and on March 5 arrived in Moscow. He had sent forward a boyar
to his mother, to his son, and to the metropolitan <span class="pageNum" id="pb475">[<a href="#pb475">475</a>]</span>with tidings that he had brought his inheritance to his will, and had made himself
sovereign in Novgorod, as in Moscow. Ivan was followed by men bringing the Assembly
bell of Novgorod, which was hung in the Kremlin tower and sounded with other bells.
</p>
<p>In spite of their exhaustion, the Novgorod people were not reconciled yet to the loss
of independence. In 1479 Ivan’s well-wishers declared to him that Novgorod was secretly
negotiating with Kazimir, who was preparing to war against Moscow, and was rousing
the Khan of the Golden Horde to attack the Grand Prince. About the same time there
was a disagreement between Ivan and his brother, so the opportunity seemed favorable
for an uprising in Novgorod. Ivan estimated the importance of the moment, and showed
no slackness. He hurried to Novgorod October 26, with only one thousand warriors,
enjoining his son to collect forces with the greatest speed possible, and follow him.
Though guards had been placed on all roads to prevent news from reaching Novgorod,
the city learned that Ivan was hastening to strike it, and immediately rose in rebellion.
People rushed to strengthen the walls; they chose a posadnik and a commander; they
renewed their Assembly. On hearing of this, Ivan halted two weeks at Bronitsi, and
waited till new forces reached him. Then he laid siege to Novgorod. The siege was
brief. Again there was wrangling of parties, and continual treason. Many went over
to the Grand Prince. Moscow guns crushed the walls, and there was no help from any
one.
</p>
<p>The Novgorod men tried to negotiate, and asked for a safe-conduct. Ivan refused, saying:
“I am safety for all who deserve it. Open the gates! When I enter I will injure no
innocent man.” They opened the gates. The archbishop and the clergy bearing crosses,
the elected authorities, the boyars, and a multitude of people went out to meet the
Grand Prince and implore forgiveness. Ivan received the archbishop’s blessing, and
said that he brought peace to all who were innocent. He went to pray in the Cathedral.
After that he stopped in the house of the new posadnik. And then he began to punish.
</p>
<p>The Novgorod men had risen up foolishly, without considering that in case of defeat
they would lose the few privileges for which they had yielded so much some months
earlier. This time, when <span class="pageNum" id="pb476">[<a href="#pb476">476</a>]</span>the uprising was ended, Ivan treated those people as rebels and traitors. First he
commanded to seize the chief leaders, and put them to torture. They declared that
the archbishop had joined the uprising. Ivan seized the archbishop, and sent him to
Moscow. His wealth, which consisted of precious stones, gold and silver, was given
to the treasury, and Sergei, a monk, was made archbishop instead of the guilty man.
More than one hundred active rebels suffered death, and their property was confiscated.
Ivan did not hold himself bound by promises made previously not to transfer men from
Novgorod to the Lower Country, and he made a broad use of this privilege, in order
to prevent any uprising in future, and to break the old stubborn pride of “Lord Novgorod.”
</p>
<p>To the Lower Country that year he removed one thousand families of the merchant class,
and descendants of boyars. Seven thousand families of common people were moved to
Moscow, and other towns and cities. In place of those he sent Moscow people to Novgorod.
In the following years these transfers were continued. The houses and lands taken
from Novgorod people were given to settlers from Moscow. By transfers of this kind
the whole population was modified. The Novgorod people, when taken to the Lower Country
and scattered, could not retain their old spirit and habits, and soon became merged
with their neighbors. The numerous colonies in Novgorod introduced Moscow ideas and
customs, and were points of support for the new order. Of course these changes brought
loss with them, and the merging of Novgorod and Moscow was costly.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the semi-separate existence of Great Novgorod, which had lasted in some
form for more than five hundred years. The fall of the city increased immensely the
power and prestige of Moscow. Ivan became an important personage, even among the crowned
heads of Europe, and now thought himself strong enough to defy the Mongols, and break
the humiliating yoke of servitude. It had been the custom, when an embassy arrived,
bearing the Khan’s portrait, as proof that they were deputed by him, for the Grand
Prince to march out to meet them, prostrate himself, offer a cup of kumis, and spread
a sable skin under the feet of the person who read the Khan’s letter. This letter
was listened to while kneeling. It is stated that Ivan now not only refused to prostrate
himself when an embassy came from Ahmed, but he seized the <span class="pageNum" id="pb477">[<a href="#pb477">477</a>]</span>portrait, trampled it under foot, and had all the envoys killed except one, whom he
bade return to his master and report what he had heard and seen, telling the Khan
further that if he continued to trouble Russia, he would be served in the same way.
</p>
<p>It is more probable, however, that King Kazimir, who feared this great accretion of
power, roused Ahmed against Moscow, promising to render personal aid. But this time
the allies let slip the right moment. The Novgorod rebellion and the quarrel of Ivan
with his brothers gave them a favorable opportunity for an attack on Moscow, but Ivan’s
statecraft and rich gifts given at the Horde by skilful envoys delayed the Khan’s
action so that the Grand Prince was able to subdue Novgorod and settle home troubles,
and then, when the moment came, to send strong forces to meet the advancing Mongols.
There was firm friendship between Mengli Girei, Khan of the Crimea, and Ivan, but
there was bitter enmity between Girei and Ahmed, the Golden Horde Khan. Of this enmity
Ivan now took advantage, and concluded an alliance with Girei against Ahmed.
</p>
<p>July, 1480, Ivan set out to join his troops in Kolomna, while his son, Ivan, with
another army, was stationed at <span class="corr" id="xd32e3884" title="Source: Serpuhoff">Serpukoff</span>, and his brother, Andrei, in Tarua.
</p>
<p>Ahmed advanced with a large army toward the Oká, but learning on the way that the
chief crossings were defended by Moscow men, he moved westward, and after passing
the Lithuanian boundary approached the Ugra River, which formed the boundary of Moscow.
Ivan was informed of this movement in season, and his son and brother were able to
reach the Ugra before the Mongols, and seize the main fords and crossings. Meanwhile
the Grand Prince went from Kolomna to Moscow, which was prepared for a siege, should
the Mongols cross the river and attack the city. At the head of the people was the
strong-hearted mother of the Grand Prince. She had become a nun somewhat earlier,
and taken the name of Martha, but now she desired to remain in the city to strengthen
and animate others by her courage. Among distinguished men who remained were Prince
Michael, Ivan’s great-uncle; the metropolitan Geronti; Ivan’s confessor, Vassian,
and Prince Kaieff, Ivan’s own vicegerent. But Sophia, his wife, the Grand Prince sent
with the treasury and many attendants to <span class="pageNum" id="pb478">[<a href="#pb478">478</a>]</span>Bailozersk, and commanded to take her still farther, even to the ocean, should Moscow
be captured.
</p>
<p>When the Grand Prince neared the capital, people of the villages moved to Moscow,
and burned all the neighboring places, as was done usually to hamper besiegers. Many
were greatly dissatisfied with Ivan’s return. They did not like to have him leave
the main army. His confessor spoke boldly, accused him of fear and timidity, and used
the word “fugitive.” He even sent a letter to the prince, in which he appealed to
Ivan’s pride, his honor and his ambition: “It is our duty to speak the truth to kings,
and what I have already declared to you, mightiest of sovereigns, I now write in the
hope of strengthening your purpose. When you set out, moved by the entreaties of the
metropolitan and the loftiest of your people, to battle with the enemy of the Christians,
we implored God to grant you victory. Nevertheless we hear that on the approach of
the ferocious Ahmed, who has killed so many Christians, you bowed down before him
and begged for a peace, which he contemptuously refused. Oh, prince, to whose counsels
do you listen? Surely they are not worthy of the name of Christian. From what heights
of grandeur have you not descended? Would you surrender Russia to fire and sword,
its churches to pillage, and your people to the Mongol’s sword? What heart would not
be broken by such a disaster? Where can you expect to reign after sacrificing the
people God has confided to you? Can you mount like an eagle and make your nest among
the stars? The Lord will cast you down. But you will not desert us, and prove yourself
a coward and a traitor. Be of good courage,—there is no God like our God. Life and
death are in his hands. Remember the glories of your ancestors, Vladimir Monomach,
the terror of the Polovtsi; and Dmitri, who conquered the Mongols on the Don. He boldly
faced Mamai, notwithstanding his oath of allegiance. We will release you from an oath
extorted by violence—a breach of faith which will save the Empire is preferable to
a fidelity which will ruin it. God will grant you a glorious reign, you and your sons
and your sons’ sons, from generation to generation. In the past you have defeated
the infidel, but what says the Evangelist: ‘He that shall endure unto the end shall
be saved.’ Do not blame my feeble words—for it is written: ‘Show the wise man knowledge,
and he will be wiser.’ Thus may it be. Receive our blessing, <span class="pageNum" id="pb479">[<a href="#pb479">479</a>]</span>you and your sons; your boyars and your brave warriors, children of Jesus Christ.
Amen!”
</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, the indignation of the people was great against the Grand
Prince for not showing more boldness, and was expressed with such emphasis that he
finally withdrew to Krasni-Seltso. In later days it became evident that a deep and
far-seeing policy and not fear had caused this seeming hesitancy. At that time, however,
no man could understand it, for the Russian army numbered, it is said, one hundred
and fifty thousand, was well organized, and had a powerful artillery.
</p>
<p>In place of moving against the enemy, Ivan ordered his son to Moscow. But the son
was eager for battle, and risked his father’s wrath by remaining with the army near
the Ugra. He was under the direction of Prince Holmski, the experienced voevoda. The
Grand Prince commanded Holmski to seize the young man and send him to Moscow by force.
Holmski did no more than to advise the youth to go, and he received this answer: “I
would rather die where I am than go to my father.”
</p>
<p>Ivan at last yielded to public opinion and the words of the clergy. After remaining
in Krasni-Seltso for a fortnight, he went to the army; but he halted before reaching
the village of Kremenets, and sent gifts to Ahmed with a message requesting him to
withdraw: “War not against thy own land,” said the Grand Prince.
</p>
<p>The Khan, upon receiving the message, commanded Ivan to visit him, according to the
custom of his fathers. When he refused to do so, Ahmed demanded that he send his son
or brother. Again he was met by a stern refusal. The Khan then agreed to the sending
of Basenkoff, a boyar, who had been at the Horde, had brought gifts and enjoyed the
Khan’s friendship. But the Grand Prince would not send even Basenkoff. During this
time Ivan was constantly urged by the people of Moscow and by his officers to advance
on the enemy, but he remained deaf to all advice and avoided decisive engagements,
showing no inclination whatever to imitate Dmitri, his great-grandfather. According
to his calculation, an expectant attitude would break Ahmed’s forces at last. He was
waiting also for news from Mengli Girei, his strong, resolute ally.
</p>
<p>Ahmed, on his part, showed no eagerness for battle. He stood <span class="pageNum" id="pb480">[<a href="#pb480">480</a>]</span>facing a numerous and well equipped Moscow army, and did not urge action. He boasted
that he was waiting till the rivers should freeze, and then, when all the roads were
open to Moscow, he would advance, utterly destroy that city, and punish his servant
Ivan for withholding tribute and homage. But in reality he was waiting for his ally,
King Kazimir, as on a time Mamia had waited for Kazimir’s father, Yagello. This time,
too, the waiting was long and useless, though for a different reason—Mengli Girei,
to assist the Grand Prince, had made a furious attack on Volynia and Kief, and thus
drawn Kazimir’s forces southward.
</p>
<p>It was autumn. Already frost had come, and by October 24 strong ice was on the Ugra
and there was a safe road over the river. Ivan’s army was strengthened now by the
coming of his brothers, Boris and Andrei, with their regiments. These brothers had
been reconciled to Ivan through the influence of Martha, their mother.
</p>
<p>But neither the Russian nor the Mongol army showed any inclination to cross the river.
At last Ivan commanded his troops to withdraw from the Ugra and join him in Kremenets.
Not satisfied with this, he withdrew to Burovsk, promising Moscow and his angry commanders
to meet the Mongols there, where the broad plain was well suited for a battle-field.
But the Khan, for some unknown reason, had no thought of following. He may have feared
ambush, or he may have been disconcerted by the reconciliation of Ivan with his brothers,
and by the failure of Kazimir to assist him, and the news of Girei’s movements in
the south. Meanwhile the thinly clad Mongols were suffering severely from frost and
bad weather. They remained till November 11, when the Khan quietly withdrew from the
Ugra, and marched southward. Thus both armies, after facing each other for a long
time, disappeared from the field without fighting.
</p>
<p>Though the people of Moscow had been greatly dissatisfied with Ivan’s conduct, they
now greeted him with honor and solemnity, nay, with deep joy, understanding at last
with the clearest conviction that the question of the Mongol in Moscow was settled
forever.
</p>
<p>The events which followed justified Ivan’s immense caution; they turned it into prudence
and made it seem admirable, for the Golden Horde had put in the field large forces,
and victory <span class="pageNum" id="pb481">[<a href="#pb481">481</a>]</span>on the Ugra would, at the best, have been bought with much bloodshed and dearly.
</p>
<p>Not long after this triumph of diplomacy, the Horde was destroyed by the Mongols themselves,
without any bloodshed for Russia.
</p>
<p>When returning to the steppes, Ahmed, raging with anger at Kazimir for his slackness
and unfilled promises, fell to plundering Lithuanian regions unmercifully. Laden with
immense booty, he halted at the Donets to winter there. But the wealth which he had
gathered roused the greed of Ivak, Khan of the Shiban Horde, who, aided by Nogai murzas,
made a sudden attack upon Ahmed and killed him. Ivak sent a swift courier with these
tidings to Ivan in Moscow, and received gifts in return.
</p>
<p>The last blow was given to the Golden Horde by Girei, Khan of the Crimea, Ivan’s faithful
ally, against whom a mortal hatred was cherished by Ahmed’s descendants. Girei attacked
the Golden Horde at Sarai, its capital, and destroyed it completely. Ahmed’s son,
then Khan of the Horde, sought refuge among the Nogais. Later on he went to the Sultan
at Tsargrad, and at last to his famous ally, the King of Poland. There he was put
in prison, however, and the king sent word to Mengli Girei that as long as he remained
in peace his erstwhile disorderly neighbor would be retained in durance.
</p>
<p>Thus in 1505 ended the Golden Horde, or the Horde of Sarai, which had so bitterly
oppressed Russia for more than two hundred and forty years. The continuation of the
Horde was the small Astrakhan Kingdom, once a vassal state in Batu’s mighty empire.

</p>
<p>“The death of Jeremiah Curtin robbed America of one of her two or three foremost scholars.
His extraordinary translations of the Polish novels of Sienkiewicz would have been
enough to establish a first-class reputation for any man. But nothing that he did
was more important than his studies of the rise of the mighty Mongol Empire and its
decadence. In this particular field no other American or English scholar has ever
approached him.”

<p>The myth tales included in this volume were collected personally by the author, during
1887, in the west of Ireland,—in Kerry, Galway, and Donegal,—and taken down from the
mouths of men who, with one or two exceptions, spoke only Gaelic, or but little English
and that imperfectly. To this is due the fact that the stories are so well preserved,
and not blurred and rendered indistinct, as is the case in places where the ancient
Gaelic language, in which they were originally told, has perished.

</p>
<p>Mr. Curtin is the first to give to the public a volume of Irish popular tales which
<i>may justly be ranked with the best recent collections of popular tales in Germany,
France, and Italy.… A delightful book alike for the scholar and general reader.</i>—<i>The Nation.</i>
</p>
<p>I have now read the whole of your “Irish Myths,” with perhaps one exception, and I
compliment you most heartily upon the book. <i>It is wonderfully fresh and suggestive, and in the mere capacity of a lot of fairy
stories it ought to have a big circulation.</i> Fin MacCool and the Fenians of Erin were great fellows anyway.—<i>Charles A. Dana.</i>
</p>
<p>A contribution to the literature of the subject which is of the very first importance.…
The stories are wonderfully fresh and distinct, and they are pervaded with a most
rare and delicious humor.—<i>The Beacon.</i>
</p>
<p>A more thoroughly delightful book has not come to hand for many a long day. Its tales
have, in the first place, the genuine ring of original myths, the true ring of folk-lore,
that indescribable naïveté which is as charming as it is inimitable.—<i>Boston Courier.</i>
</p>
<p>No more interesting or more valuable contribution to the literature of this subject
has ever been made.… The tales in this book are very charming. They cover a wide range,
and to adults as well as to children of tender years they are simply fascinating.—<i>Quebec Chronicle.</i>
</p>
<p>The work of the collector is not only performed faithfully, but with such intelligence
that the stories have a value in literature worthy of being added to the Norse sagas
and other tales of wild adventure and myths.—<i>Boston Journal.</i>

</p>
<p>These are thrilling hero-tales. No extract can do the stories justice. Any one taking
up the volume will not be likely to lay it down without reading it.—<i>The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette.</i>
</p>
<p>Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, whose translation of the novels of the great Polish novelist,
Sienkiewicz, introduced him to English readers, has shown equally admirable skill
in rendering into English many ancient hero-tales of Ireland. The stories are marvels
of exaggeration, and have a genuine Irish flavor. Champions, giants, fairies, and
witches work their wonders and spells in a fascinating way.—<i>The Outlook.</i>
</p>
<p>The people of this country ought to be grateful to that accomplished American scholar,
Jeremiah Curtin, for the translations from varied and quite dissimilar foreign languages
which he has added to our literature. His version of the wonderful novels of Sienkiewicz
opens up to us a most interesting department of history, of which English-speaking
people have hitherto been profoundly ignorant; and his latest publication, “Hero-Tales
of Ireland,” is perhaps quite as valuable, with the added charm of a wild, delightful,
primeval Celtic imagination.—<i>The New York Sun.</i>

<p>A volume as fascinating as any fairy book that was ever published; and simply for
their wealth of imagination and rare simplicity of diction these stories will be widely
